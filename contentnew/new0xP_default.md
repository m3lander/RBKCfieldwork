1. Introduction

Quality of life is a multifaceted concept encompassing the general well-being of individuals and societies, including not just wealth and employment but also the built environment, physical and mental health, education, and access to services (Smith, 2020). Inequality refers to the disparities among people in their command over social, economic, and environmental resources (Jones, 2019). These disparities can manifest economically, socially, and environmentally, leading to significant variations in quality of life within urban areas.

The London Borough of Kensington and Chelsea exemplifies stark contrasts in quality of life within a relatively small geographical area. Despite being the wealthiest borough in the UK, it contains some of the most deprived wards alongside areas of extreme affluence (RBKC Council, 2022a), as highlighted by the data in figure 2. Investigating these disparities is crucial for understanding urban inequality and its implications on residents' lives.

*Figure 1 Bar chart showing income deprivation in Kensington and Chelsea (**ONS**)*

The increase in income inequality amongst developed countries, especially advanced economies such as the UK and USA, has become increasingly topical and contentious following the 2008 financial crisis (Hudson et al., 2016) as Oxfam discovered that in 2015, the richest 62 individuals held the same amount of wealth as the bottom 50% ($1.75 trillion) (Hardoon, Fuentes-Nieva and Ayele, 2016) indicating the disparity in capital distribution and therefore level of economic inequality globally. This income inequality is visually apparent in figure 2, with the Gini coefficient graph demonstrating continued inequality in the UK.

*Figure 2 Graph displaying income inequality in the UK (House of Commons Library, 2023)*

While UK household income tends to vary spatially, with London having the highest median income before housing costs (?662) (Harari and McGuinness, 2019), this fails to account for the massive inequality present not just between different London boroughs, but also within a single borough.

This study focuses on two wards within the borough: Golborne, identified as one of the most deprived areas and the ground-zero of the Grenfell Fire Tragedy, and Brompton & Hans Town, renowned for its luxurious offerings and affluence. By comparing these wards, the investigation aims to assess the extent to which quality of life varies within Kensington and Chelsea.

### 1.1 Aims of Study

This study aims to investigate the extent to which quality of life varies within the London Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, the most socioeconomically divided borough in England

In comparing the Golborne ward and the Brompton and Hans Town ward, I will specifically assess and evaluate discrepancies in three key facets of quality of life; social deprivation, economic welfare and environmental degradation. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of intra-urban inequality.

## 1.2 Hypotheses

To guide this investigation, three main hypotheses have been formulated:

### 1.2a economic inequality

Brompton and Hans Town ward has a higher level of economic prosperity than Golborne ward.

### 1.2b environmental inequality

Golborne has a higher level of environmental degradation than Brompton and Hans Town. \
        - This is based on theories of environmental justice, which suggest deprived areas often experience poorer environmental conditions (Walker, 2018).

### 1.2c social inequality

The level of social deprivation is higher in Golborne than in Brompton and Hans Town.

- Supported by Bourdieu's theory of social capital, indicating that access to resources differs between social classes (Bourdieu, 1986).


These hypotheses will be tested through a combination of primary and secondary data collection methods. Primary data will include environmental quality and index of decay surveys, photographic evidence accompanied by qualitative annotations, and perception of crime surveys.

Secondary data will be sourced from government statistics, local council reports, and academic literature. The study will employ both qualitative and quantitative approaches to ensure a comprehensive analysis of the inequality present in these two wards.

### 1.4 Theoretical Context

1.4a Economic Prosperity \
The concept of economic inequality is central to this investigation and will be assessed through indicators such as income distribution, housing affordability, and employment rates. Thomas Piketty?s (2014) theory of wealth concentration highlights how economic inequality increases when the rate of return on capital exceeds the rate of economic growth, leading to a growing divide between the affluent and deprived. In urban areas like Kensington and Chelsea, this disparity is evident in the extreme differences in property values and income levels. While the affluent ward is expected to benefit from high disposable income, high employment rates, and access to economic opportunities, Golborne is likely to experience significantly higher levels of unemployment, lower income, and greater housing stress. The Gini Coefficient and the Index of Multiple Deprivation will be utilised to quantify income inequality and provide a statistical measure of economic disparity (Gini,1921).

### 1.4b Social Deprivation

Social deprivation in this investigation will be explored through differences in education, health outcomes, and crime rates between the two wards. Pierre Bourdieu?s theory of social capital (1986) provides a useful framework for understanding how access to resources such as education and social networks contributes to the persistence of inequality. In affluent areas, access to elite private schools and better healthcare facilities is much higher, contributing to better social outcomes. This contrasts with deprived wards, where schools are often underfunded, and healthcare facilities are less accessible. The Coleman Report (1966), a landmark study on educational inequality, will provide additional context for understanding how socio-economic background influences educational attainment. This report highlights that socio-economic factors, rather than school resources, determine educational outcomes, which will be particularly relevant when comparing the educational facilities and opportunities in Golborne and Brompton & Hans Town.

### 1.4c Environmental Degradation

Environmental justice theory indicates that marginalised communities often experience higher levels of environmental degradation (Walker, 2018), with factors such as lack of green spaces, poor housing conditions, the presence of illegal graffiti and fly-tipping being more prevalent in deprived areas. The Green Space Index Score will provide insights into the accessibility and quality of green spaces in both wards.

### Urban Theories of Inequality

 \
This investigation draws on several other socio-economic and geographical theories, ensuring my investigation is structured upon a well-documented foundation. This is imperative in avoiding a superficial, assumptive investigation and will allow me to gain a nuanced and insightful understanding of the mechanisms driving quality of life disparities and inequality in the borough.

The Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) will be a key tool in assessing levels of deprivation across different domains, including income, employment, health, and environment.

Bourdieu?s theory of cultural capital will also be applied to understand how disparities in education and social mobility contribute to broader inequalities. Bourdieu argued that cultural capital; such as education, intellect, and social networks, plays a crucial role in maintaining and reproducing social inequalities. This theory is especially relevant in Kensington and Chelsea, where access to private schools and cultural institutions varies widely between affluent and deprived areas.

Furthermore, urban theories of inequality, such as those developed by David Harvey (1973) and Henri Lefebvre (1991), suggest that urban spaces are often sites of socio-economic exclusion, where capitalist processes of accumulation and development concentrate wealth in specific areas while marginalising others. Harvey's notion of the "right to the city" argues that urban development benefits the affluent at the expense of the poor, depriving lower-income communities of resources and opportunities. This idea will help frame the investigation's exploration of how inequality is spatially manifested in the built environment of Kensington and Chelsea.

Urban inequality is far from unique to London, with other UK cities like Blackpool also exhibiting significant disparities within a single urban area.  To understand the extent to which high crime rates, poor housing and environmental conditions contribute to disparities in Quality of Life between residents of different socioeconomic backgrounds, I will examine whether Blackpool provides an example of such geospatial inequality** which I hypothesise to also be the case within the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea Despite its reputation as a popular seaside resort, Blackpool faces significant challenges related to deprivation and inequality. According to the 2019 English Indices of Deprivation, Blackpool is the most deprived local authority in England (Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government, 2019). Life expectancy varies by up to 13 years between its most and least deprived areas (Blackpool Council, 2021), highlighting stark health inequalities. This overall ranking masks even more extreme variations at a smaller scale, with some neighbourhoods in Blackpool experiencing levels of deprivation that are among the highest in the country, while other areas remain relatively affluent.

Educational attainment also reflects a clear disparity, with students from disadvantaged backgrounds significantly underperforming compared to their peers from more affluent areas (Department for Education, 2020).  From an economical view, while some parts of Blackpool benefit from the tourism industry, others suffer from high unemployment rates and low-wage seasonal work. These economic disparities are reflected in the housing market, with some areas characterised by poor quality, overcrowded housing, while others feature well-maintained properties and higher property values. This example underscores how profound disparities in quality of life can exist within a relatively small geographical area, a pattern which I will seek to investigate within the borough of Kensington and Chelsea and seek to understand the similarities and differences between factors driving disparities in quality of life. \

## 1.6 Geographical Location

The selection of Golborne and Brompton and Hans Town is intentional, as they represent starkly contrasting socioeconomic profiles within the same borough. This allows for a focused examination of how inequality manifests in areas in close geographical proximity but with vastly different social and economic characteristics.

The Golborne Ward is ranked among the top 10% most deprived areas nationally according to the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) (Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government, 2019) and exhibits substantially higher unemployment rates, lower average incomes, and reduced access to quality housing and services (RBKC Council, 2022b).

In contrast, Brompton and Hans Town ward is ranked as one of the least deprived areas nationally, characterised by high property values, elevated income levels, and superior access to amenities (RBKC Council, 2022c).

*Figure 7 Ward map of Golborne and Brompton Hans **Town** - not to scale*

My decision to select the Golborne ward for my comparative investigation was in part influenced by the rich opportunity to evaluate the socio-spatial processes contributing to deprivation. However, when comparing it to an affluent ward, it will be essential to explore how different urban planning, investment, and community development strategies shape life outcomes. The study of such contrasting areas can provide insight into whether policies aimed at reducing inequality are effective, or if the disparity continues to grow.

In justifying the choice of Golborne ward, the focus on income deprivation affecting children offers a compelling case. Deprivation disproportionately affecting younger populations speaks to broader intergenerational issues and raises questions about long-term urban policy effectiveness. A potential approach could be to investigate whether initiatives targeting child poverty, such as educational support or welfare programmes, have mitigated the disparity between wards.

*Figure 7 Ward map of income deprivation affecting children (IMD, 2007) - not to scale*

The map in figure 7 illustrates the proportion of children aged 0-15 living in income-deprived households. In Kensington and Chelsea, 24 LSOAs are ranked among the top 20% most deprived in England, primarily clustered in the northern borough, particularly near the Hammersmith and Fulham borders. Conversely, 38 LSOAs are in the top 20% least deprived, predominantly in southern, more affluent areas.

In justifying the choice of Golborne ward the focus on income deprivation affecting children offers a compelling case. Deprivation disproportionately affecting younger populations hints at broader intergenerational issues and raises questions about long-term urban policy effectiveness. A potential approach could be to investigate whether initiatives targeting child poverty, such as educational support or welfare programmes, have mitigated the disparity between wards.

*Figure 8 2009 Child Wellbeing Index Map - not to scale*

The Child Wellbeing Index (CWI), developed as part of a government initiative to assess deprivation among different population groups, ranks neighbourhoods based on seven domains: health, material well being, education, crime, housing, environment, and children in need.  \
The CWI allows me to build a more nuanced understanding of deprivation beyond simple income measures, factoring in broader quality-of-life indicators that directly impact children. In Kensington and Chelsea areas ranking in the top quintile for child deprivation are likely to suffer from issues like overcrowding, poor housing conditions, and limited access to services, all of which can significantly hinder child development.

Child deprivation correlates closely with long-term social mobility challenges, as children in deprived areas tend to face compounded obstacles throughout the course of their life. This statistic aligns with the idea of a ?poverty trap? in urban environments, where socio-economic conditions in childhood heavily influence future opportunities.

# 3. Data presentation & analysis

### 3.1 Hypothesis 1: To what extent does Brompton and Hans Town ward have a higher level of economic prosperity than Golborne?

### 
#### Multiple Home Ownership

![](/imagesnew/su3_Image_10.png)

*Figure 9 Bar chart looking at the proportion of residents who own multiple properties (**[www.ons.gov.uk](www.ons.gov.uk)**, n.d.)*

```
The ability to own multiple homes, with one located in London (which is ranked the fourth most expensive city globally in 2023 (McCarthy)), is a clear indicator of wealth. Consequently, the fact that individuals in BHT are 14x more likely to own multiple properties compared to those living in GR highlights the significant economic inequality between these wards. Moreover, GR is comparable to the household average, with only 3% of UK households owning a second home (GOV.UK, 2022), demonstrating the limited percentage of the population that can afford such a level of house ownership. Thus, the 42% rate of second-home ownership in BHT in figure 9 reinforces this recurring notion of wealth inequality. Evidence supporting this observation extends beyond demonstrating economic inequality in that it evidences how this disparity can further exacerbate inequality - the rising rates of home ownership have led to a decrease in overall wealth distribution (Maclennan, 2023). Additionally, the inequitable distribution of home ownership can have adverse repercussions, such as displacing local residents and creating a negative multiplier effect where these properties are not always occupied by residents who contribute to local businesses and services.
```
#### Economic Activity comparison

![](/imagesnew/Fht_Image_11.png)

*Figure 10 Bar chart comparing economic activity between the two wards*

```
Despite a lack of overall initial pattern in this figure, the data presented still exemplifies economic inequalities between BHT and GR. The absence of any ?vacant shops/businesses? in BHT support this, as a vacant street suggests both economic stagnancy and lack of competition/desire for businesses to set up. This is reinforced visually in this bar chart due to GR having 5 ?vacant shops/businesses?, - the fact that this scores joint 3rd for the highest tally count implies a lack of consumer spending power, with locals lacking the disposable income to support local businesses and thus limited business opportunities as there is a reluctance for shops to set up (negative multiplier effect). This is also reinforced by the later examined photograph (figure 38) which highlights this vacancy. This could also be symptomatic of high levels of crime (explored later in my crime survey - figures 60 to 66), as these businesses could have experienced financial losses and have been forced to close down. Moreover, the lack of ?pawn shops? in BHT in comparison to 3 in GR indicates economic wealth, as the market for a pawn shop suggests a market for people needing to sell off possessions when short of cash ? something which is less likely to be occurring in BHT which addresses economic inequality. One of the most striking data samples I collected was the number of ?high-end retail stores?, as well as ?organic food/ingredient shops? in BHT compared to 0 in GR. This underscores the affluence of BHT residents, further demonstrating the extent to which economic inequality is pervasive. Additionally, the ?organic food/ingredient shops? is also suggestive that those on BHT have more income, time, and energy to invest into their health (reflected by this health-conscious consumerism) implying that this economic inequality has ramifications for health and therefore is a confounding factor in contributing to social inequality. In addition, the data for number of ?laundrettes? (5 for GR) is indicative of the level of income deprivation in Golborne as the high market demand for laundrettes shows that some are unable to afford home appliances such as washing machines, whereas BHT residents are likely to have both multiple washing machines, and perhaps in some cases, the means to pay staff to do their washing for them.
```
#### Discrepancy in prices of select goods and services

![](/imagesnew/S5z_Image_12.png)

*Figure 11 Bar chart looking at % difference in prices of select goods and services*

![](/imagesnew/cxI_Image_13.png)

*Figure 12 Bar chart looking at the average price and % difference between Golborne and Brompton & Hans Town*

```
These price disparities in figures 11 and 12 are indicative of the broader economic inequality between the two wards. According to the Cost of Living Theory (Engel, 1857), households with higher incomes tend to spend more on goods and services, driving up prices in affluent areas due to increased demand and the ability to pay premium prices. This creates an environment where only the wealthiest individuals can afford to reside comfortably, which exacerbates socio-economic segregation.
Furthermore, the Spatial Inequality Framework suggests that such economic disparities within close geographic proximity can lead to social stratification and reduced social cohesion (Smith, 2011). Residents of lower-income areas may experience limited access to high-quality goods and services, which has the added effect of reinforcing cycles of poverty and limiting opportunities for upward mobility.
The significant differences in the average prices of common goods and services between Golborne and Brompton & Hans Town are thus clear indicators of economic inequality, as the cost of living is directly linked to residents' purchasing power and overall quality of life. For instance, the price of a basic men's haircut in Brompton & Hans Town (?32.00) is nearly four times higher than in Golborne (?8.50), highlighting a substantial disparity in service costs that could affect affordability for residents of lower economic means.
The higher cost of leisure activities and amenities in Brompton & Hans Town further emphasise these economic disparities. A gym membership averages ?60.00 per month in the affluent ward, almost triple the ?22.00 average in Golborne. This disparity highlights how Brompton and Hans Town residents are not only able but also willing to pay this premium price, as well as being reflective of the lower income level in Golborne. However, the lower average price in Golborne means these gyms are more affordable, potentially positively impacting the health and well-being of these residents. Moreover, the cost of a meal at a pizzeria is ?25.00 in Brompton & Hans Town versus ?12.00 in Golborne, indicating that dining out is considerably more expensive and thus less accessible to individuals with limited financial resources. However, though those with limited disposable income would be more able to afford dining out in Golborne, the huge difference in the prices of meals and staple foods (e.g. the bread loaf) could suggest differing qualities of ingredients and produce, thus perhaps revealing higher demands and expectations for produce quality in Brompton and Hans Town, as residents have the money and capacity to care for their health. Therefore, this illustrates how although there is evidently a higher cost of living in BHT, this can be attributed to the fact that people in this are able to afford these prices, hence possibly also pricing out poorer residents.
```
## **3.2 Hypothesis 2 = Brompton and Hans Town ward has a higher level of economic prosperity than Golborne.**

#### Brompton & Hans Town annotated photographs

I annotated these photographs with key visual indicators to indicate the value of the economic assets on each street.

*Figure 13  Brompton & Hans Town*

```
The many windows in the grand stucco fronted house that is central to the image in figure 13 are far larger than the majority of those in Golborne Road. This is significant as large windows are desirable and signify wealth, indicating the value of the properties in this area. 

Moreover, the sheer scale of this house (4 storeys and 3 windows wide, combined with tall rooms) demonstrates their grandeur and monetary value, reinforced by the fact that this house was last sold in 2017 for ?7.5m. Added details such as a doric porch and a balustraded balcony emphasise this. 

Furthermore, the well-pruned trees on the first floor balcony not only contribute to the high EQS score for this area, but they also indicate that the homeowners have the time and money (disposable income) to maintain these plants ? a feature clearly less prevalent in Golborne Road as shown by their relevant photos.

*Figure 14  Brompton & Hans Town laser eye clinic store front*

```
The fact that the signage on this window for a laser eye clinic is in 3 languages other than English (Russian, Chinese, Arabic) highlights a diverse international crowd that reside in this area as this specific marketing is appealing to a clientele of wealthy elite migrants. This suggests that this clientele who have the means to afford this surgery are attracted to/are present in this area. The theme of this attracting wealthy clientele in this area who have much disposable income is reinforced by the fact that on the website the price is apparently ?from ?2,000 per eye?.
```
![](/imagesnew/3KQ_Image_16.png)

*Figures 15+16  Brompton & Hans Town*

```
The uniform appearance of the housing on this street suggests that much care (and time and money) is put into maintaining this presentation, illustrated by the matching pruned trees, even paintwork and smart iron railings. Furthermore, the wealth of this street is emphasised by the cleanliness of the street in figure 15 (as residents perhaps have more money to invest in their area). Moreover, in the window in figure 16, evidence of security presence (CCTV signage) shows residents can afford a high level of private security infrastructure, and have valuable assets (reinforced by the ring doorbell and red alarm in front of the house).

*Figure 17  Brompton & Hans Town: Waitrose*

```
The presence of exotic potted plants and green foliage outside this Waitrose highlights how they can afford this to entice customers who feel they belong in this type of supermarket, creating a sense of order and cleanliness, reinforced by the huge windows, even paintwork, and glass doors. The fancy building for just a supermarket (it is a 180 year old building within the Duke of Westminster?s Grosvenor Estate) illustrates a sense of the type (and wealth) of clientele who visit this shop, furth exacerbated by the ornate detailing of the architecture by the windows.

*Figures 18, 19, 20  Brompton & Hans Town private garden*

```
These photos are capturing Cadogan Place Gardens ? private communal gardens intended only for Cadogan residents. These are clearly well-maintained neat gardens, with clean well-looked after paths, and spanning 3.5 hectares - a huge amount of land considering the price of land in this part of London. Furthermore, the grandeur of these gardens and sense of wealth is further demonstrated by the royal signage in figure 18, as well as the clear repeated emphasis on the privacy of these gardens in figures 19 and 20(CCTV warnings, a set of rules, and the fact a key card is needed to enter). Moreover, the fact that these gardens contain an entire water garden and multiple tennis courts clearly highlights the extent of the wealth of these residents, who clearly have great access to beautiful, private, and well-maintained green spaces - something that is not present for the majority of Golborne Road ward residents.

*Figure 21 Brompton & Hans Town embassy*

```
The Ecuadorian embassy is depicted in this image, occupying a smart red brick Edwardian building. Embassies are often found in the most exclusive/wealthy parts of London as they are safer, desirable, have good police presence, and nice buildings, demonstrated by the well-maintained exterior and abundance of windows - something that is often seen as a status symbol. Furthermore, there is a huge security presence with multiple CCTV cameras and iron railings barricading the entrance, thus illustrating the value and importance of these buildings and their residents. Moreover, the clean even brickwork and absence of graffiti is a stark contrast with the later analysed images taken in Golborne Road ward.

*Figure 22  Brompton & Hans Town*

```
The grand and wealthy architecture style found in this ward is further reiterated by this image, illustrated by the presence of balconies, even paintwork, and clean porches, hinting at the disposable income of the residents who are able to afford both these buildings and their upkeep. Moreover, the roads are smooth, clean, and wide, creating an open and safe environment. Moreover, barred windows add to the aforementioned idea of a high security presence, indicating the ability of the people living here to afford this, and their desire to protect valuable possessions.

*Figures 23 and 24  Brompton & Hans Town shop fronts*

```
These two photos highlight the presence of specialist niche shops/buildings targeted for a specific wealthy market found in this ward - people on an average salary unlikely to shop here or be able to afford to shop here. The Map House in figure 23 is London?s oldest specialist antique map dealer, designated for wealthy collectors. Moreover, Gladwell & Patterson, the internationally renowned art gallery in figure 24 has been granted various Royal Warrants in its time by multiple monarchs, highlighting its grandeur. Moreover, it was founded in 1746, and thus 
clearly makes enough profit to have been around so long. Furthermore, it is thus arguably situated in good proximity to wealthy people, as a shop as niche as this would be unlikely to succeed as a business in an area like Golborne Road as later shown by the typical shops found on the streets in that ward.
```
![](/imagesnew/mV4_Image_27.png)

*Figures 25, 26, 27  Brompton & Hans Town shop fronts*

```
There is also clearly a high presence of designer shops with attractive storefronts to entice customers, with Love Luxury in figure 25 selling things such as designer bags, watches, and jewellery, thus revealing their wealthy local clientele. Moreover, according to the website of Pacha of London (the watch shop in figure 26), ?Pacha of London have established a well respected reputation of selling superb quality, rare and collectable timepieces & diamonds?, thus reiterating this point. This is further reinforced by Bella Ling in figure 27- yet another luxury clothing outlet. Thus, it is clear that these shops are targeted to extremely wealthy people, with these designer items being far out of the budget of an average salary. Thus, the apparent success and abundance of luxury/designer shops is indicative of the wealth found in this area.

*Figure 28  Brompton & Hans Town*

```
This photo depicts a typical high street found in this area, as despite the poor weather, the photo has a welcoming and friendly atmosphere ? reinforced by the EQS score of this area. Moreover, the flag bunting perhaps suggests an attempt to appeal to diverse and international residents. Furthermore, the clean pavements devoid of litter is a stark contrast to many streets found in Golborne Road, further emphasising this environmental quality inequality.

*Figures 29, 30, 31  Brompton & Hans Town*

```
These three figures clearly depict the relatively high amount of greenery found in this ward, as well as the appealing and attractive architecture, thus demonstrating the high quality of the environment and attractiveness of this area, reinforced by the grand building with columns under the entrance canopy and rustication on ground floor exterior in figure 29.

*Figures 32 and 33  Brompton & Hans Town*

```
In this photo there is a large presence of London Black Cabs, something which is a classic ?symbol? associated with the UK. The fact they are waiting for clients suggests that they are regularly used by wealthy shoppers on this street, as they charge more than other cab companies such as Uber, and are thus seen as more of a luxury. Furthermore, the building in these photos houses Harrods ? a quintessential British department store known for its luxurious costly products and  wealthy clients, a stark contrast with the stores found in Golborne Road ward. The presence of a doorman in uniform reinforces this, illustrating the high level of customer service that is expected by shoppers, and how the department store is wealthy enough to afford to employ this sort of work.

*Figure 34  Golborne Road ward*

```
The brutalist architecture of Trellick tower, a grade 2 listed tower block containing much social housing (apartments) immediately demonstrates far less architectural uniformity as was depicted in the images of Brompton & Hans Town ward. Moreover, the faded road signs perhaps suggest less investment by local authorities.

*Figures 35 and 36 Golborne Road ward shop fronts*

```
In figure 35 there are clear indicators of decay ? loose wires, graffiti, dirty stained walls all indicate an inability (due to both time and money) to maintain upkeep of these shops/apartments. Moreover, the fluorescent lighting and fast food (and less inviting atmosphere) of Planet Pizza contrasts heavily with the Waitrose found in figure 17. The presence of cheap fast food indicates a market for convenient cheap filling food which is often desirable for those with less time on their hands to cook, and those who can't afford to worry about ingredient quality (as later explored). Moreover, this is further reinforced by figure 36, indicating the typical diet of residents, catering to a market in need of cheap easy meals. The poor quality of the environment is also shown by the presence of rubbish bags by the tree in figure 36, making the area appear more dirty and unappealing.

*Figure 37  Golborne Road ward*

```
The Malaysian flag bunting potentially indicates the diversity of this area. Moreover, there is also clearly poor pavement quality here ? the uneven and bumpy ground contrasts with that shown in Brompton and Hans Town, posing a possible hazard for wheelchair users (inaccessible), and contributing to the ward?s poor EQS score and high Urban of Decay score.

*Figure 38  Golborne Road ward*

```
The ?For Sale? signage and closed shop shutters suggests a lack of desire for shops to set up here. Furthermore, the presence of graffiti suggests a lack of care for the image of the local area, contrasting with the high maintenance shown in the Brompton and Hans Town pictures. In addition, there is also another juxtaposition between the wards due to the smaller windows and floors, connoting a feeling of crampedness. The CCTV and graffiti is perhaps indicative of a high crime rate in this area.

*Figures 40 and 41 Golborne Road ward*

```
In figure 40, the presence of fallen over rental e-bikes indicates a lack of care and connotes untidiness. Moreover, the prevalence of fly-tipping on this corner contributes to the lower EQS score, as it makes the area more unappealing and appears dirty. In figure 41, there are damaged car parts laying on pavement, suggesting reckless driving occurred in this area, and also posing a safety hazard for those using this pavement.

These three photos clearly exemplify further fly-tipping, with the sheer amount of it suggesting it is both a common occurrence, and also that it is not dealt with regularly thus perhaps indicating a failure by local council/authorities, as well as a sense of a lack of individual care for their surroundings. Thus this helps explain the poor EQS score due to the uninviting and dirty pavements. In addition, the graffiti on the mattress in figure 44 indicates that it has probably been there for a long time, reinforcing this idea of poor maintenance and quality of the environment.

The presence of car bollards on the pedestrianised pathways poses the question of their necessity, perhaps implying prior reckless and illegal driving in this area. Moreover, this residential building is arguably less attractive than those found in Brompton and Hans Town, illustrated by the smaller windows, lower ceilings, stained tiles and damaged ventilation, suggesting cramped conditions and a far higher inhabitant density.

This image is another example of far more cramped housing than found in Brompton and Hans Town, which can be attributed to the fact that smaller housing is cheaper for the residents who typically inhabit this ward. The paint/tiles are also relatively grimy, reinforcing this continued theme of poor maintenance and potentially poorer quality building materials.

The dirty sign/map in figure 4 clearly has undergone weather damage (due to the water stains) over a relatively long period of time, with this high level of damage emphasising the minimal regular maintenance compared to the clean street signs in Brompton and Hans Town. Moreover, the community noticeboard in the local park in figure 48 contains two faded posters as well as the board being water damaged/stained board, demonstrating how it is rarely used, and thus indicating potential absence of adequate community cohesion. This park signage is a stark contrast with the park signage (and private parks) in the Brompton and Hans Town images.

```
Though there is some green space in this image, it does not rival that of the far bigger and private Cadogan Place Gardens (figures 18,19,20), which could be attributed to how Cadogan Place Gardens has wealthy residents who contribute to the upkeep. Moreover, the barren ground is uninviting and lacks the presence of people. This is exacerbated by how it is very overlooked and has no benches, thus, though Golborne Road ward does have green space as explored in Green Space Index, the quality of it hugely differs.

#### Index of urban decay:

![](/imagesnew/TEJ_Image_56.png)

*Figure 56 Bar chart looking at the comparison of average index of urban decay scores*

```
The lack of data present in figure 56 for average index of urban decay scores for BHT is a result of the fact that when I recorded this data, there was no indicators of urban decay for the indicators of ?displaced roof material?, ?significant structural damage?, and ?rotting timber/rusted material?. In comparison, GR has a minimum 6 for its average score. This demonstrates the differences in environmental quality for both streets, by not only suggesting that BHT receives better maintenance, but also that perhaps their buildings are made of more quality materials (reinforced by the photos in figures 13-33). This better maintenance could be linked to the economic wealth present in BHT, as the fact that they likely have greater disposable wealth allows them to have more capital to invest back into their living area. In turn, this can arguably better their quality of life by providing them with less stress about their living situation. This stress is reinforced by the fact that the aforementioned indicators which BHT scores an average 0 for are all prominent and suggestive of both a far greater visual sense of urban decay, but also potentially unsafe living conditions (?rotting timber?, ?significant structural damage? etc). This is a flaw of my data collection and presentation method, as the layout of my bar chart suggests that each indicator is valued equally in terms of the level of urban decay, however it?s arguably wrong to equalise ?peeling paint? and ?displaced roof material? as equal indicators, as ?displaced roof material? is far more problematic and likely to affect local?s daily lives and affect their mental state. Thus, if I were to redo this survey, I would choose to measure both the frequency and the degree of urban decay.

*Figure 59 Map of Access to Green Space for Golborne & Swinbrook (Friends of the Earth, n.d.) - not to scale*

```
The data in these maps from ?Friends of the Earth? provides in-depth data surrounding the access to green space that both streets have. Surprisingly, Hans Town and Brompton score the lowest rating of E (?neighbourhoods that are the most deprived of green space, including gardens and parks), with the average garden area per person being 8m2, and average public green space per person being 0m2. In comparison, Golborne and Swinbrook scored a green space rating of D, with the average garden area being 5m2 , and the average public green space per person being 30m2. It is clear that in terms of the local environment, BHT is suffering far more in terms of access to public green space, thus going against my hypothesis. However, this can be explained by...
Horniman?s Pleasant Park ? 15 year old shot dead whereas BHT they have comm. Squares and private green spaces in addition to (small) gardens and/or Hyde Park
While Golborne is shown to have a higher Green Space Rating (D) than BHT (E), I suspect that this is somewhat anomalous and is a result of the extensive green space that is the Kensal Green cemetery being included in the data ?Less garden PP, photos of cemetery, Meanwhile Gardens, JHP and canal pathways; in reality the green space is ?
In addition to this, Holborne does score an average 3m2 extra per person for average garden area (and this is supplemented by private gardens), displaying not only that HBT residents are likely to have bigger gardens, but also that they are therefore more able to afford this luxury. Furthermore, despite HBT being closer to the city centre (where property/land prices get higher) which should suggest that gardens get smaller (find data to back up), the data highlights how they in fact still have bigger gardens than those in GR, demonstrating the power of their wealth. Moreover, an explanation for my weaker findings from this source of data (and a weakness of these maps) is that it is an average for a wide area (rather than looking at more individual streets), so is less specific - it being an average can conceal inequalities within the area.

```
As part of my investigation into urban inequality and discrepancies of quality of life within the London Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, I conducted a crime survey to examine the disparity in crime levels between GR and BHT. My survey focused on visually observable crime indicators, which I categorised into two distinct tables: (1) ?Comparison of Crime Indicators between Wards? and (2) ?Comparison of Crime Prevention Indicators between Wards.? This segmentation is crucial as it reflects not only the occurrence of criminal activity but also the measures taken to prevent crime, which I hypothesised would differ between the two economically diverse wards.

The results from the ?Comparison of Crime Indicators? table show that Golborne is disproportionately affected by higher levels of visible crime, including vandalism, graffiti, and littering which aligns with my initial hypothesis regarding the correlation between inner-city deprivation and elevated crime rates. This supports the broader concept that socially and economically deprived areas generally experience more visible signs of crime due to a combination of lower investment in public infrastructure, greater societal tensions, and often overwhelmed local law enforcement capabilities. However, a notable limitation of this survey is the reliance on visual confirmation of crime, which inherently conceals more insidious types of criminal activity (e.g., drug trafficking, domestic violence) that are less observable during a street survey. 
To address this limitation, I incorporated secondary data from the Metropolitan Police (figures 62-64) to gain a more comprehensive understanding of crime trends in both wards. This secondary data provides insight into the types of crime that are not immediately visible, allowing for a more comprehensive evaluation of the crime disparities between the two areas. This will serve to both triangulate my findings, especially within areas that suffer from high levels of a particular crime, but also strengthen the validity of my analysis by incorporating official crime reports. This will assist me in reducing the bias introduced by the visual nature of the primary data collection method, which has the potential to exacerbate harmful stereotypes, counter-intuitive to my investigation.

Furthermore, the data gathered from the ?Comparison of Crime Prevention Indicators? reveals an interesting pattern in terms of security measures in both wards. GR shows a higher frequency of deterrents such as security fencing, theft prevention signs, and behaviour enforcement signs, indicating a heightened need for such preventative actions in response to elevated crime levels. This could reflect the broader urban theory suggesting that deprived areas implement reactive measures to mitigate crime due to a combination of higher crime rates and lower social cohesion.

On the other hand, BHT, despite its status as an affluent ward, surprisingly recorded a higher ?average number of CCTV cameras per road.? At first glance this anomaly contradicts my hypothesis that BHT would have fewer signs of crime prevention due to a lower prevalence of crime. However, this discrepancy can be explained by the nature of CCTV ownership. While a significant portion of CCTV cameras in Golborne were located on public property, those in BHT were largely installed by private homeowners. This highlights an important socio-economic factor: the ability to afford and invest in private crime prevention technology.

The prevalence of privately owned security devices in BHT points to the unequal distribution of crime prevention measures across constituency, council a lines. In contrast to GR, where crime prevention is more reliant on publicly funded infrastructure (e.g., council-installed cameras), BHT residents have the financial means to safeguard their homes through the purchase and maintenance of private security systems. This observation reinforces (my) if I can hypothesise earlier link between economic capital and crime prevention, suggesting that affluence enables residents to actively reduce their exposure and vulnerability to crime through personal investment, thus further entrenching spatial inequalities.
Thus, the ?average number of CCTV cameras per road,? while a potential reflection of security concerns, also serves as an indicator of economic inequality, potentially perpetuating a cycle where wealthier individuals are more able to insulate themselves from urban crime.

*According to the Trust for London, the royal borough of Kensington and Chelsea (ROYAL BOROUGH OF KENSINGTON & CHELSEA) has a poverty rate of 29%, compared to the average London borough of 27%, and income deprivation of 0.7 (relative to London overall). However, **these numbers are skewed? **	 **risks hiding?**? As while the child poverty rate is 10% lower than both the London Borough average of 33% and the England average of 31%, the three wards in the North of the borough have higher rates of child poverty than both the London* and national averages, reaching as high as 57% in some wards.

#### Age Distribution of Children living in Out-of-work Benefit Claimant Households

![](/imagesnew/YW6_Image_68.png)

*Figure 68 Pie chart comparing the  proportion of total number of children between the two wards*

```
The data clearly evidences disparities in child poverty between Brompton & Hans Town (BHT) and Golborne, which provides evidence of entrenched social inequality. It?s interesting to note, however, that neither Golborne nor Brompton and Hans Town claim the spot for highest and lowest number of children living in benefit claimant households respectively, with BHT enjoying the 4th lowest number while Dalgarno and Notting Dale both top Golborne with the highest and lowest number of children li The stacked bar chart demonstrates that Golborne has approximately 395 children living in out-of-work benefit claimant households, representing 90.8% of the total children in such circumstances between the two wards, while BHT accounts for just 40 children (9.2%). This dramatic disparity aligns with Bourdieu's (1986) theory of social reproduction, whereby socioeconomic disadvantages tend to perpetuate across generations within specific geographical areas.
The age distribution data is particularly telling, with Golborne showing significantly higher numbers across all age brackets, but especially in the 5-15 age range. This concentration of child poverty during crucial developmental years supports Wilson's (1987) concept of neighborhood effects, where geographical concentration of disadvantage can amplify negative outcomes. Research by the Nuffield Foundation (2021) indicates that children exposed to poverty during these formative years are significantly more likely to experience limited social mobility and reduced life chances, creating what Townsend terms an "intergenerational transmission of deprivation."
However, limitations exist in this dataset's interpretation. The out-of-work benefits metric alone may not capture the full spectrum of child poverty, as it excludes households experiencing in-work poverty or those just above the benefit threshold. Additionally, the data represents a static snapshot and doesn't reflect the dynamic nature of household circumstances or seasonal variations in employment patterns. Following the Spatial Inequality Framework (Smith, 2011), this concentration of child poverty in such close geographic proximity to areas of extreme affluence may exacerbate social tensions and further reduce opportunities for social cohesion between the two wards.
This extreme polarization in child poverty rates between two adjacent wards exemplifies what Harvey (1973) describes as the "spatial concentration of disadvantage" - where social inequalities become physically embedded in urban geography, creating distinct pockets of deprivation that can persist across generations.

The IMD looks at a number of broad themes, including income, employment, education, health, crime, barriers to housing and services, and the living environment. (Consumer Data Research Centre, 2020), thus providing a composite and accurate way to compare social inequality between HBT and GR. As a result, the fact that GR falls into the most deprived decile clearly highlights the scale of deprivation on multiple levels present in this area. This is a stark comparison to the colours found in the second map. 
Anomaly in BHT is due to the housing estate

However, limitations of this data are the fact that census maps divide up areas of London into OAs (Output Areas), which are the lowest level of geographical area for census statistics, which generally follow ward boundaries. As a result, OAs are made up of between 40-250 households with resident populations between 100-625. By being by area rather than by individual street or household, the data for each OA could thus conceal inequalities. This could mean that specific households in BHT that score highly on the IMD actually score much lower individually, but other households in the same OA lower the average (the housing estate), thus potentially skewing the comparison.

# 4. Conclusion & Evaluation

## 4.1 Hypothesis 1 - Brompton and Hans Town ward has a higher level of economic prosperity than Golborne.

To a large extent it is apparent that Brompton and Hans Town does have a higher level of economic prosperity than Golborne. This is supported by the collected data which provides evidence for the existing economic inequality between the two locations.

This is evident with the use of figure 9 which represents the percentage of residents that are second home owners in the compared wards. The data showcase the fact that individuals in Brompton and Hans Town are fourteen times more likely to own multiple properties compared to those living in Golborne. As second home ownership is a commonly accepted indicator of wealth, and the two locations hold such a different number of residents who are one, this adds to the argument that there is economic inequality between these wards. Moreover, this can be furthered by when compared on a national scale, as only 3% of the UK population own a second home (GOV.UK, 2022). Hence as 42% of residents in Brompton and Hans Town own a second home, this clearly shows that the area is home to residents that are overwhelmingly economically prosperous on a national scale too not just in comparison to Golborne.

Additionally, the ownership of second homes is generally recognised to increase property prices within the given area, as it causes property prices to increase due to higher demand and so can uproot locals who may not be able to afford these new house prices.Consequently, this arguably increases inequality between the influx of these new ?yuppies? and locals who may be uprooted or those who can afford to remain because of previously purchasing land but may be in a different socio-economic standing.

Moreover, the economic inequality between the two locations can be further supported through the discrepancy in prices. This can be seen in figure 11 and 12 which reflects the difference in the purchasing power of residents in Brompton and Hans Town to those in Golborne. For example, the price of a basic men's haircut in Brompton & Hans Town (?32.00) is nearly four times higher than in Golborne (?8.50). Hence clearly showing a substantial disparity in service costs that could affect affordability for residents of lower economic means. The difference in pricing could perhaps also reflect the difference in locals' disposable income, with each price being relative to what is affordable for most locals and so are indicative of the broader economic inequality between the two wards, hence further adding to the hypothesis  that residents are overwhelmingly more able to afford considerably higher prices in Brompton and Hans Town. According to the Cost of Living Theory (Engel, 1857), households with higher incomes tend to spend more on goods and services, driving up prices in affluent areas due to increased demand and the ability to pay premium prices. This creates an environment where only the wealthiest individuals can afford to reside comfortably, which exacerbates socio-economic segregation. Hence as there is such a stark difference in these prices, this clearly suggests that  the residents of Brompton and Hans Town have a significantly higher economic prosperity than those in Golborne as they are more able to provide a market for these high priced goods.

Moreover, the difference in shop types within these locations further adds to this argument, with there being more ?high/end retail stores? as well as ?organic food/ingredient shops? in Brompton and Hans Town compared to there being none in Golborne. Hence as shop types often reflect the demands of the local demographic and these types of shops are likely to sell higher cost goods, this further implies that residents in Brompton and Hans Town have a higher disposable income than those in Golborne. Furthermore, the Spatial Inequality Framework suggests that such economic disparities within close geographic proximity can lead to social stratification and reduced social cohesion (Smith, 2011). Residents of lower-income areas may experience limited access to high-quality goods and services and so may be living a lower quality of life than those in more affluent areas. With there being few organic food shops, and high end clothing shops in Golborne while there are more in Brampton Hans Town, this highlights economic disparity between the residents of the two wards and the difference in their access to high quality goods and services could also suggest a difference in their quality of life.

 This economic inequality can be further supported through the photos in figures 13-53. As these photos highlight a difference in the property quality and size within the two areas, this further adds to the argument that there is a large difference in the economic prosperity between these two locations. Hence, as the data presents that the residents of  Brompton and Hans Town have a considerably higher disposable income than those in Golborne, live in larger properties with a higher quality and have a higher percentage of residents that own second homes, this clearly showcases there is a greater level of econ prosperity in Brompton and Hans Town in comparison to Golborne. 

Geographers David Harvey (1973) and Henri Lefebvre (1991), suggest that urban spaces are often sites of socio-economic exclusion, where capitalist processes of accumulation and development concentrate wealth in specific areas while marginalising others. The stark economic differences between the two locations support this theory, with wealth accumulated in areas such as Brompton and Hans Town while Golborne remains less economically prosperous. Hence using this theory, it's clear that to a large extent Brompton and Hans Town does have a higher level of economic prosperity than Golborne.

## **4.2 Hypothesis 2 - Brompton and Hans Town ward has a higher level of economic prosperity than Golborne.**

To a large extent the data collected showcases Golborne does have a higher level of environmental degradation than Brompton and Hans Town.

Firstly, this is supported through figures 54 and 55 which compares the Environmental Quality Survey for the two wards. This difference is clear as figure 55 clearly displays how Brompton and Hans Town scored higher than Golborne in all areas showing that it is a safer and cleaner environment. This environmental inequality is apparent as figure 55 highlights this difference with Brompton and Hans receiving high scores with all but one gaining either the highest or almost the highest score, while 90% of the data collected for Golborne provides it with a score of 2 or lower. Hence highlighting environmental inequality and so supports the hypothesis that Golborne does have a higher level of environmental degradation than Brompton and Hans Town.

Additionally, the Environmental Quality Survey indicators of ?natural features present?, ?condition of public and private green spaces?, and ?air and noise pollution? imply discrepancies in terms of upkeep and presence of green space. As it can be easily implied that the residents of Brompton and Hans Town overwhelmingly hold a higher disposable income, they are more able to and most likely willing to pay higher prices in return for a better surrounding environment. This could include paying for gardening, choosing housing that holds access to private parks, or paying to live in close proximity to well functioning services. Moreover, despite Brompton and Hans Town being closer to the central city, where properties are often smaller and more expensive, the ward holds a greater area of average garden area. Thus clearly showing geographic inequality, as those living in Brompton and Hans Town have better access to nicer greenery highlighted in figures 13-33), and private well-kept clean quiet gardens (figures 18-20). Therefore, when this is considered with theories of environmental justice (which suggest deprived areas often experience poorer environmental conditions) and as Brompton and Hans Town is proven above to be more affluent than Golborne, this implies that hypothesis one and two are inherently interlinked (Walker, 2018).

Moreover, the index of urban decay in Golborne is shown to have a higher level of degradation than Brompton and Hans Town. This is apparent, as figure 56 highlights that Golborne scored significantly higher than Brompton and Hans Town for every category. The figure shows that Golborne scores high ratings with all being above six and one category reaching the highest score of 10 suggesting that the area holds environmental degradation. Comparatively, the average score for Brompton and Hans Town did not reach above a low three and a zero in three categories presenting a low level of degradation. When recording this data, I found that there were no indicators of "displaced roof material", "significant structural damage", or "rotting timber/rusted material". This not only suggests that  Brompton and Hans Town receive better maintenance, but also that perhaps their buildings are made of more quality materials reinforced by the photos in figures 13-53 which suggests a higher quality of property. It is possible that these differences in the environment of these wards is due to their contrasting economic prosperity, as Golborne?s lower economic prosperity could discourage investment into it while driving it into more affluent areas like Brompton and Hans Town. Consequently, this could lead to issues that exist in Golborne such as poorer lighting which could encourage higher levels of crime so have social implications too. This claim is supported by figure 61 which highlights that Golborne scores higher than Brompton and Hans Town for all given categories used to assess crime within the wards. Moreover, figure 60 further adds to this argument, as it showcases that the crime prevention method of CCTV is on average found almost twice as much in Brompton and Hans Town than Golborne. It is possible that the reasoning behind this links to hypothesis one, which comes to the conclusion that residents in Brompton and Hans Town are overwhelmingly more affluent, and so will have a greater disposable income to spend on security measures such as CCTV.

However, figure 64 also shows that for 67% of the categories used, Golborne received a higher score. Perhaps, this could suggest that the ward is slowly becoming more invested in, and could become a safer environment in the future? Or perhaps, this simply suggests that due to significantly higher levels of crime, these preventative methods are more necessary than they are in Brompton and Hans Town where crime levels are lower. To conclude, the crime data  could perhaps suggest that Golborne does hold a higher level of environmental degradation than Brompton and Hans Town but that the ward may become a safer place in the future due to greater crime preventative indicators. Hence giving weight to the hypothesis that although Golborne does have a higher level of environmental degradation than Brompton and Hans this could perhaps change in the future as it could become a safer ward due to more investment in crime prevention.

Moreover, the data proposed in figure 59 shows some more optimistic trends for the environment of Golborne. The green space map shows Golborne has more green spaces than Brompton and Hans. This could perhaps be due to Brompton and Hans' closer location to London?s CBD meaning that large areas of green spaces are hard to find due to it being largely built up, but either way this still shows that Golborne technically has more green spaces to offer to its residents. Moreover, these green spaces remain usable and are frequently used by residents with it seeming to be busy when I visited to collect my data. Comparatively, the green spaces in Brompton and Hans were noticeably empty when visiting (figure 50 and 53), suggesting that locals may not feel the need or ability to use it. This could perhaps be explained by the fact that in July of 2024, a 15 year old boy was shot and killed in the park (BBC, Low). Hence, as this event happened not long before I visited the ward, this recent event could still be deterring locals in Brompton and Hans from using these green spaces due to fear of it being unsafe and a breeding ground for crime. Instead, the larger gardens in Golborne may be perceived as more desirable and present safer spaces for residents in the comfort of their own home. Hence, giving some weight to the argument that Golborne does not have higher environmental degradation than the ward of Brompton and Hans.

Finally, through the conducting of a crime survey (figure 60 and 61) it is clear that there are high levels of visible crime such as graffiti, vandalism and littering in Golborne. These crimes could perhaps be occuring due to a poor perception of the area, amongst residents and visitors who may hold limited attachment to the place and so may feel less inclined to keep it litter free and the walls graffiti-less. Hence, these crime rates and types clearly align with my initial hypothesis about the correlation between inner-city deprivation and elevated crime rates. This supports the broader concept that socially and economically deprived areas generally experience more visible signs of crime due to a combination of lower investment in public infrastructure, greater societal tensions, and often overwhelmed local law enforcement capabilities and so shows how the economic prosperity of the two wards impacts their environment too. Thus when all is considered, it is apparent that Golborne does hold a higher level of environmental degradation than Brompton and Hans.

## **4.3 Hypothesis 3 - The level of social deprivation is higher in Golborne than in Brompton and Hans Town**

To a large extent it is apparent that there is clearly a higher level of social deprivation in Golborne than in Brompton and Hans Town. This is supported by my collected data which supports this conclusion.

Firstly, hypothesis three is supported by the fact that there is a drastic difference in educational opportunities between the two wards. For example, as is highlighted in figure 71, Brompton and Hans, residents living in the circled area lived within a half a mile radius to many schools both primary and secondary. However, out of the 23 schools presented only four of them were state schools and they were all primary. Hence, as 82.6% of schools that are situated in a close proximity to the area are private, it is likely that they are situated there due to its residents being affluent enough that they can afford to privately educate their children and due to their being a demand from locals for this type of education. Thus as data from the government shows that as of 2019 only 7% of British people were privately educated, this clearly shows that its? residents are overwhelmingly affluent, reinforcing hypothesis 1 that Brompton and Hans Town is more economically prosperous than Golborne (figure 72), as a considerably smaller 36.4% of schools within the data are private (Gov, Elitism in Britain). Hence, as the majority of schools within Golborne as state schools and so are accessible for everyone, whilst the vast majority of those in Brompton and Hans are private and so are closed to most people excluding the elite, this suggests a disparity in the social and economic inequality of the residents between the two wards.

Moreover, it is likely that social inequality will continue and most likely become amplified between these two wards. This is predictable as due to their difference in the availability of private and state education explored above. With private schools often achieving greater educational attainment and results and historically sending their pupils off to well-known universities, state education receives less funding and so often sees the majority pupils receiving lower grades. With lower grades, students may find their opportunities limited, including going to elitist universities which then opens up many doors and opportunities for its graduates.  Hence, as this a cycle which will continue to repeat, it is likely that social inequality will become greater between the two wards for as long as their available types of education remain the same, as students will likely have different opportunit?s and therefore lives based on their grades and schooling. This can be supported by Bourdieu's theory of social capital which fundamentally argues about the cycle mentioned above, that access to resources differs between social classes (Bourdieu, 1986) in this case through education.

Additionally, it is possible that this difference in education could possibly have powerful ramifications on the long term socioeconomic status of their family and children. Low or lower levels of education and grades can lead to a poverty cycle which could perpetuate deprivation within Golborne. This is emphasised by figure 69 which shows the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) for the ward based on data from 2019. The figure clearly shows that under the IMD the ward is considered as deprived, with the vast majority of the area being categorised under either the second or third most deprived category. This not only explains the reasons for less private schools in the area, as these high levels of deprivation mean that it is unlikely that most residents have a demand for this type of education as they are most likely unable to afford it due to having a lower disposable income. Whereas, this is shown to differ from Brompton and Hans Town, with figure 70 showing that under the IMD the ward is considered not as deprived. The ward is categorised, with the vast majority of it being a blue colour meaning that it is overwhelmingly considered as a not deprived area, with several sections of the map even being coloured in a darkest blue, showing that it is the least deprived decile. There is an anomaly which shows an area coloured in red and categorised as the second most deprived decile with the area surrounding it being ranked as the third, fourth and fifth. This can be explained by the location of the housing estate which can be found in the most deprived area and so suggests that there may even be extreme economic and thus inherently also social inequality between residents within the same ward, with some residents being categorised as the most deprived, while others were considered to the least, despite living in a close proximity. Hence, it is clear that although there is a variation in the deprivation found in Brompton and Hans it is overwhelmingly a less deprived ward than Golborne, as is supported by the evidence collected to answer hypothesis one. It is apparent that the overwhelming socio-economic standard of residents in the two wards differ greatly suggesting economic inequality and thus inherently social inequality too. Therefore, when this is considered it is clear that there is a higher level of social inequality in Golborne than there is in Brompton and Hans Town.

Adding on, this theme of social deprivation can be further followed when looking at the Distribution of Children Living in Out-of-work Benefit Claimant Households Across All Wards (figures 67 and 68). This is clear as the graph (figure 67) highlights that Golborne holds a high number of almost 400 children, ranking it as the third highest ward out of the eighteen listed. Whereas, Brompton and Town Hans has a low number of less than forty children, and is ranked as the fourth lowest ward. Hence this clearly highlights not only a difference in the overwhelming economic prosperity of the residents within the two wards (figure 68) (helping us to answer hypothesis one), as fewer parents require financial aid in Brompton and Town Hans, but also suggests social inequality between the two wards. This can be supported as a lower economic standard, is likely to see people living a lower quality of life, due to a smaller disposable income and so will have less money to spend on non-essential items. As a result, it is likely that children residents that are living on benefits are more likely to live a low quality of life in comparison to those who do not require this aid. Thus, as there are almost 10 times more children on benefits in Golborne than in Brompton and Hans Town, it is likely that there are more people experiencing this low quality of life. Therefore, this data on benefits further supports the argument that to a large extent social deprivation is higher in Golborne than in Brompton and Hans Town.

Moreover, research conducted by the Nuffield Foundation suggests that there is a correlation between children that undergo experience such as poverty during their childhood and committing ?serious? offences and ?frequent criminal convictions in adulthood? (Nuffield Foundation). Thus, this study could perhaps present a reason for the higher crime levels in Golborne, that were used to support hypothesis two. It is possible that through growing up in an environment of deprivation, Golborne has become a breeding ground for crime with residents that grew up there who may become more inclined to commit crimes as they enter adulthood. This experience differs from the vast majority of residents in the more affluent area of Brompton and Hans Town, where deprivation measured by the IMD is considerably fewer and less children are living on benefits. Hence as crime levels are also considerably lower in Brompton and Hans Town than in Golborne, this could perhaps suggest a correlation between these factors, of higher levels of deprivation often leading to higher levels of crime. Therefore, it is clear that there is stark social inequality between the two wards and their r?sidents and so clearly adds weight to the argument that to a large extent there is a higher level of deprivation in Golborne than Brompton and Hans Town.

Furthermore, figures 60-66 further explores crime within the two wards and helps us to understand their comparative deprivation. The figures indicate economic inequality, as well as social inequality. Figure 64 highlights that crime data is 9.39% in Brompton and Hans Town while figure 63 shows that Golborne is a slightly lower 8.10%. While this raw data may on the surface suggest that there is higher deprivation in Brompton and Hans Town than Golborne as crime is often perceived as a factor towards deprivation, when explored further it is likely that there is a greater reason for these statistics.

Possible reasons for higher crime in Brompton and Hans Town when it comes to theft, vehicle offences,robbery and bulgare can be attributed to the fact that its residents' greater economic prosperity and wealth  make them a more suitable fit for crime, due to higher assumed reward for the criminal. Moreover, it is likely that residents of Brompton and Hans Town may be more likely to put their wealth on display through expensive items such as cars making them easier targets for crime when compared to Golborne, where citizens may hold a lower disposable income and so may be unable to display wealth in this same way. This theory can be supported by the data in figure 60 which shows that the average use of CCTV is considerably higher in Brompton and Hans Town in comparison to Golborne and so suggests that its residents may believe that they have expensive goods to protect. Adding to this argument, using the data presented by the IMD it is clear that there is social inequality within Brompton and Hans Town with their pockets of deprivation existing alongside extreme wealth. Hence, this stark inequality within such a close proximity is likely to breed discontent and jealousy and could lead to crime. This could perhaps provide a reason for the data that is presented in the three figures.

Additionally, the greater prevalence of crime prevention indicators in public to reduce antisocial behaviour such as security fencing and behaviour reinforcement signs used in Golborne (figure 60) could imply that there is deprivation within the area by suggesting a necessity for these signs to be implemented, as it implies that visitors and or residents may feel inclined to commit criminal offences. As people are often incentivised to commit crimes on the basis of economic desperation, this could perhaps suggest that Golborne residents recognise this deprivation within their community, to the extent that they feel the need to protect themselves from becoming a victim to it.  This is reinforced by the results presented in figure 61 which disproportionately displays greater recorded visual indicators of crime in Golborne than Brompton and Hans Town, which could provide a reasoning for why residents may perceive their area as unsafe and feel the need to take precautions in order to feel safe. Comparatively, figure 61 highlights that Brompton and Hans Town experienced considerably lower levels of the crimes measured in the table and so from this data we can infer that visitors and residents may feel less inclined to commit the petty crimes listed. Hence, if they are less incentivised to commit these acts, combined with the areas higher average prices, lower ranked deprivation on the IMD map, this clearly supports the argument that to a large extent there is a higher level of deprivation in Golborne than in Brompton and Hans Town.

## **4.4 Overall Conclusion**

To what extent does quality of life vary between deprived and affluent wards within the London Borough of Kensington and Chelsea?

In conclusion, the quality of life in the London Borough of Kensington and Chelsea between deprived and affluent wards differs largely. It is strongly supported by the evidence that Brompton and Hans Town ward has a higher level of economic prosperity, has lower levels of environmental degradation and lower levels of social deprivation than Golborne, which supports my hypotheses. Despite London being a wealthy city, large inequalities were discovered in these two wards which are close in proximity and are both in the same borough, which highlights the pervasiveness of inequality. Moreover, this evidence could imply that this pattern of inequality is not just local but can also be reflected on a regional and national scale, such as the North South divide. Therefore, despite theories of inequality being a feature of developing countries, this investigation demonstrates that inequality can still be rife in richer cities of developed countries. London has the highest median income within the UK before housing costs (Harari and McGuinness, 2019), yet still has similar patterns of inequality with Blackpool which has traditionally been depicted as deprived.

## **4.5 Socio-political considerations:**

Throughout the investigation, I tried to prioritise ethical considerations during data collection across both wards that I studied. Photography was conducted with careful attention to privacy and being as non-invasive as possible, ensuring all images captured did not include any individuals and focusing solely on the necessary environmental and structural elements. Moreover, data collection was carried out efficiently and respectfully, minimising time spent in residential areas and strictly adhering to public access zones to avoid any intrusion into private property. Additionally, my investigation employed digital data recording methods using a smartphone and laptop, not only promoting environmental sustainability by eliminating paper waste but also reduced the overall environmental impact of my research process. On top of this, I aimed to maintain academic integrity through comprehensive documentation of all information sources, with proper citations and references included for all secondary data. This systematic approach to ethical considerations ensured the investigation was conducted responsibly and respected the inhabitants of both wards I investigated.

## **4.6 Evaluation of methods:**

| Method title | Why valid method | Drawbacks | How reliable results and conclusion | Any changes? potential modifications to increase validity |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Annotated photos | This is a valid method as by using this qualitative method, the data is visually engaging and simple, with my annotations ensuring that key indicators of inequality are highlighted and clear. | A limitation is daily external
environmental factors, which could
alter perceptions of these areas. Because the photos were taken on a day with variable weather conditions, as such, the photos that were taken when it was darker and wetter could negatively impact someone?s impression of the area, resulting in an unfair presentation of that area.

Furthermore, the autumn season in
which I took the photos could also
contribute to this, i.e. a more
negative perception
due to leaf litter and puddles.
Moreover, another limitation is my
sample size, as by
using systematic sampling, I could
have missed relevant features. | The reliability of this is illustrated by how I took the photos and thus had control of ensuring and selecting that the pictures were useful and relevant to my specific investigation. It also means that the photos were taken recently and were thus not out of date and unreliable, increasing the validity of my subsequent analysis and conclusions.  | I could have tried to capture the photos at times of similar weather conditions so as to reduce any bias via external factors.
 |
| Index of urban decay survey | Assessing and examining the extent of decay and damage of the properties/overall areas was a valid way to explore inequality. 
Additionally, my method of scoring the extent of decay and calculating total decay scores for comparison ensured I explored a multitude of indicators. | One drawback of this method is how the scoring and results were subjective and dependent on what I can spot, as well as the way it treats each indicator as equal
(i.e. ?peeling paint? scoring the same as ?boarded up windows?). Moreover,
external conditions like light levels and
weather could impact and exacerbate
the visibility of certain indicators, for
example how misty it 
thus limiting the validity and objectivity of the results. | Although the reliability is slightly undermined by the subjective nature of this survey, the results are nevertheless still reasonably reliable. This is due to how I conducted the survey in both wards on the same day straight after each other, thus minimising the risk of external influences such as time of day (school run and commuting in the morning/evening) impacting my results in one of the areas.  | To try to increase the validity, next time I could enlist numerous people to record results in order to get more comprehensive and thus valid results. I would also choose to measure both the frequency and the degree of urban decay, to reflect which indicators of decay have a bigger impact on locals. |
| EQI |  The validity of this method is highlighted by how I selected indicators that were most suited to my investigation and subsequent wards, as well as how the rating system and total overall score made my final data easily comparable.  | A drawback of this form of data
collection is how the quality of the environment (and the ranking)t are
subjective. This is because not only are they dependent on the time spent collecting
data and the mood of the investigator,
but the scoring could also be impacted
by the weather and time of year. | Although the reliability is slightly undermined by the subjective nature of this survey, the results are nevertheless still reasonably reliable. This is due to how I conducted the survey in both wards on the same day straight after each other, thus minimising the risk of external influences such as time of day (school run and commuting in the morning/evening) impacting my results in one of the areas.  |  To try to increase the validity, next time I could enlist numerous people to record results in order to get more comprehensive and thus valid results. Furthermore, with more time I could repeat the survey during different seasons and hours of the day in order to account for and appreciate variations that could arise from this. |
| Crime survey | Allows individual-level safety perceptions and actual crime dynamics through collecting both statistical and experimental data. Researchers are therefore able to develop a valid understanding of spatial inequalities related to security and safety.  | Drawbacks include potential underreporting of incidents which would distort the data, variations in crime reporting across different demographic groups (age, gender, ethnicity and more). Moreover, the reliance purely on visual crime indicators excludes and overlooks invisible/hidden crime, limiting the validity of my results. I did partially rectify this by using secondary crime data from the Metropolitan Police, but this also has its limitations as not all crimes are reported. |  This data collection method is reliable, however the reliability could be improved through comparing official crime statistics with resident experiences, and initiating an anonymous reporting method. This may incentivise more individuals to report crimes thus enhancing the reliability of the data collected.  |  Potential modifications to this survey could include segregating the survey based on demographic characteristics (age, gender, ethnicity and more). Moreover, implementing digital reporting methods will make reporting crime incidents more efficient and will incentivise a higher number of individuals to report crime incidents.  |
| High street services survey |  By mapping available services, researchers can understand inequalities in urban access provision. This method allows a systematic approach to service distribution, and its validity is confirmed through the comprehensive understanding of economic infrastructure.  |  A drawback to this method is that it does not capture the quality of the services available on the highstreet, alongside it being difficult to quantify accessibility.  |  This is a reliable method to capture the quality of services on high streets, however it could be improved through incorporating qualitative community feedback to aid a better understanding of the quality of services available on the high streets of each spatial location.  | Recommended modifications include integrating an accessibility assessment, as some of these services may be unable to use in different spatial locations due to the average salary in the area.   |
| Local Business Retail Price Index survey |  This method is quantitative which aids its validity as it is less subjective than qualitative data. Therefore, this valid method allows the understanding of economic disparities, providing valuable insights into the variations of cost-of-living and economic accessibility.  | Methodological drawbacks include temporal price fluctuations which are not accounted for within the survey. Moreover, not all products are represented offering a distorted perspective of the accessibility to products on an economic scale.   |  The reliability of this method could be improved through standardising the product selection that is surveyed so that it offers an aligned representation on the economic accessibility in different spatial locations. Furthermore, contextualising price data with broader economic indicators, such as the average salary in each spatial location, would allow for a better understanding of economic accessibility on a regional scale.  | Potential improvements to this method could include incorporating qualitative economic experience data to better understand the economic accessibility in each spatial location on an individual-level. In addition, by expanding the product range there is a more accurate representation of cost-of-living issues in each area. Moreover, if I were to redo this aspect of the investigation, I could invetigate the quality of ingredients used for both, examining whether produce quality and provenance is something that customers potentially value more in Brompton and Hans Town.

## **4.7 Overall Evaluation:**

In evaluation, although my investigation was largely thorough and comprehensive, there are opportunities to consider that could strengthen and deepen my attempts to answer my hypotheses. The selection of Golborne and Brompton and Hans Town proved valuable as they represent starkly contrasting socioeconomic profiles within the same borough, and their proximity facilitated efficient primary data collection. Though my comparative investigation between the two wards revealed key inequalities, my analysis could have been expanded to include additional variables and strands of inequality to provide an even more comprehensive understanding of inequalities in the borough. Whilst I endeavoured to draw heavily on both primary and secondary data, the primary data collection was less concentrated in my social inequality hypothesis and was used predominantly when analysing environmental inequality. As a result, a more balanced use of primary data would have provided a more balanced analysis. Furthermore, though systematic spatial sampling ensured good coverage, time constraints made it tricky to effectively cover the entirety of the two wards, and random sampling for photographs, while illustrative, could have introduced personal bias that might suggest greater or lesser disparity than actually exists. The Index of Decay and Environmental Quality Index (EQI) (figures 54-56) helped quantify factors effectively, and having a single person recording these measures enhanced reliability by ensuring consistency and that any systematic biases remain constant rather than variable. Thus, though my primary data collection was partially hindered by its inherently subjective nature and time constraints limiting my ability to repeat surveys, I undertook a variety of precautions to help control for external factors to the best of my ability. Additionally, a potential limitation of some secondary data is that ONS maps examining Output Areas (OA) rather than data per street/ward may conceal disparities. However, the secondary data that I utilised is still substantially reliable and valid due to its official sourcing and government approval, further strengthening the investigation. Overall, my investigation utilised reliable primary and secondary data to help provide valuable insights into disparities between the two wards I explored, thus reinforcing the validity and reliability of the subsequent analysis and conclusions I came to, and thus my overall investigation.
