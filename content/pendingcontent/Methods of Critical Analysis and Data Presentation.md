# Tips From Lesson
Needs to be structured by hypothesis
Hypothesis 1 - present all data, analyse all data, next hypothesis
Questionnaire might support different aspects, still keep separate in MCA + DP

Variety of different things - graphs, maps, tables, photos
Underneath the map / data include a little **6-marker like** in that: Data manipulation, patterns of trends, relationships (i can see xxx and this links to the data in xxx e.g. questionnaire which suggests this)

I calculated Simpson's diversity index by finding the sum of
The value I calculated was … to x sig figures which i then… final value for the calculation
**Lots of Data Analysis**
Presenting things on maps is always beneficial  - **Spatial** **Patterns**, **manipulation**, **anomalies, relationships**
**Richter Scale of Health**
Key, annotated photos, 

**NEED 'LINK TO THEORETICAL CONTEXT SUBHEADING'**
to apply existing theory, knowledge and geographical concepts 
*In introduction use a variety of literature to form hypothesis - I found this from this literature and i'm using it to test this*

returning to theory > conclude that xx - answering hypothesis. 'this is why it's important, this is what i found out'

**How Representative is my Data**
*When you evaluate how rep. data is - only did x questionairres, only could visit on one day, had x problem that may mean my data is not representatative - some comments*
**Conclusions and Evaluation** - need to comment on the ACCURACY and the EXTENT to which the data is representative
