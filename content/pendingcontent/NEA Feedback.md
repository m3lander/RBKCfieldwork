# Geographical Background and Justification Feedback
## Geographical background - essentially displaying knowledge of inequality as a concept, using sources to back it up

*The choice of Golborne and Brompton and Hans Town as study areas is deliberate, as they represent contrasting socioeconomic profiles within the same borough. This allows for a focused examination of how inequality manifests in areas in close geographical proximity but with vastly different social and economic characteristics. By investigating these wards, the study aims to contribute to the broader understanding of urban inequality and its localised impact*
+ Define and explain (in context additionally)
+ Discuss global spatial variations e.g. North-South divide globally but also in the UK
	+ Within this, touch on the 3 strands of inequality, explaining what inequality in these areas looks like (with evidence)
+ Examine parallel example (preferably a more extreme example, allowing for a captivating transition and focus into my specific place comparison
	*Give context as part of the parallel example so it does not look out of place or like i've talked about it purely for the sake of it - it should be clear throughout that the example is directing the narration towards my specific example*
Bring the focus of the exploration of inequality from global > national (UK North-South divide), and then into London, evaluating inequality in London and the corresponding nuances, challenges, limitations etc, before finally shifting the focus towards my specific borough (RBKC) with a captivating, analytical statistic.

## Geographical Location Justification
+ personal justification - lived near Grenfell and was actively involved in the post-incident community response > link personal, qualitative experience and narration with compounding statistics and evidence to comprehensively justify the choice of location...
	This should be a multi-level, rigorous, insightful, critical and analytical justification, supporting the decision to choose the RBKC, the 2 specific wards within the borough, and why I chose those wards specifically for comparison.

# Introduction Feedback 

> Gini national scale - i'm interested in borough scale

*The decline of areas..+ Grenfell - personal (vested) interest /?
Replace all RBKC with full name at the end

**Location Justification**
*this data not only reaffirms* - answering the question, save some of the maps for the critical analysis 

Spatial variation part should be used in the secondary evidence in answering the hypothesis #

Aims > links > hypothesis and only THEN does it come into the theoretical context
Move "Inequality +++ " to theoretical context 
Start with aims, then link to spec, hypotheses, and t

Parallel example **only a few sentences / 1 para**- a report into inequality found this… (equality trust) - Blackpool
In my report I will see if the same applies  
Maps and justification can be quicker 


## Literature review 
After theoretical context, quick table evaluating the sources
Source+Rating+Comment 
Age, bias, political agenda, change over time, 
SEGMENT THEORETICAL CONTEXT 
what is already known - Gaps in existed knowledge, contested thinking etc 

Broken down the theory behind each context / hypothesis. 

Bulk of theory > paragraph for each hypothesis, explain how it impacts the
Report, commentary >> I'm going to test whether that's true, *link to aim + action* > I'm going to find out…

# Methodology Feedback
Very beginning before the table > Add pilot study; tested questionnaire to gauge public perception, gauging risks, 
Maps of where data was recorded 

When, Where, Repeated on, Annotated photos

Full hypothesis not environmental 
Photos not photos - opportunistic sampling (for some), using judgement to try build a representative photos - walked round 100% of streets to ensure spatial representation 
comment about both positive and negative feedbacks

Don't need limitations column > take out but SAVE for evaluation

Index of Decay: Set of instructions that someone can replicate exactly; detail the indicators, exactly HOW, minute detail, 

14 different areas.. to ensure large sample size + sys. samplimg to ensure spatial representation

Location needs to be clear
"SEE APPENDIX > copy of the recording sheet in sections below > ++ annotations 
"Help quantify the features I see"

Sampling justification for IoD > Spatially representative of the whole area 
Stratified AND then systematic > spatial representation?

"It may not be self-evident why adapting an approach influenced by Bourdieu might be the best practice, particularly as Rowelle and Lingard (2008) acknowledge that he did not write anything directly about education policy. However, there are many reasons why the work of Bourdieu has been highly influential within my research. These include Bourdieu’s own epistemological stance and the need for reflexivity within research, the importance Bourdieu placed upon empirical research and a rejection of the over reliance upon established theoretical ideas, the concepts or thinking tools created by Bourdieu that can be adapted and related to my own research, and Bourdieu’s interest in power imbalance and the subjugation of those with a low socio-economic status."

## Parallel Example - Blackpool


Global - **Regional** > London
	It's within **regional** that this case study excels, use to further the *implications of the north-south divide and the gravity of it*
	

```ad-CaseStudy
title:  Case Study
“Decades of under-investment in the North have hollowed out preventative services, increased rates of children in care and undermined foster care provision, leaving local authorities at the mercy of the private residential care providers,
(the evidence) Shows the damage caused by cuts to prevention and failure to address the very real problem of child poverty in the North"
