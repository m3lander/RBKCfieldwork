### **Intro**

### feedback from teacher
- Change “Geographical location justification” to just “Geographical location”
- At some point you will need to add figure numbers to the images and maps that you have throughout the NEA. Your text should reference these. E.g. “Goldborne (Fig 3) shows that” or “as seen in Fig 3, Goldborne…”
- I honestly think you can get rid of both red sections. Concision is better than too much theory!
- The maps you have chosen aren’t particularly clear. Have one showing location at London scale, 1 more zoomed in and then one more showing the boundary of your NEA sites and where you collected data.
- Everything after and including  “IMD 2007 – Income Deprivation Affecting Children” on p17 doesn’t need to be there.

### **Methodology**

- Before your table, you should have a short paragraph explaining why you did a pilot study. You might mention that it helped you hone your questionaire, conduct a risk assessment and check for suitable sampling sites
- There shouldn’t be a limitations column in the table. That can be used in your evaluation table after your data analysis
- You need to state the location/time of each method. Rather than enter that into the table, have a short statement before the table saying that “all techniques were conducted …..at … and…”. Have a map which shows the location of your methods (This can be the one at the end of your intro)
- When you get to Occurrence of crime.. You can put the secondary data sources into one row. E.g. Secondary data (e.g. Crime, IMD data)
- I don’t think you need the retail or property prices at the end of the table (it’s just too much!)
- Do include the high street service survey as that allows you to present the data on a map (which will look good and give you credit)

### **Critical Analysis**

- You need a variety of presentation techniques. At the moment it’s very graph heavy. Photos, a land use map (retail survey) and proportional symbols or radar graphs, located on a map (EQI) will be best. I can show you examples.
- Your actual analysis is detailed and effective. Remember to keep your overall question in mind so that you are always focused on answering how “quality of life varies”. You can return to this at the end of each bit of analysis, a bit like you would in an essay e.g. “Therefore, it is clear that…’quality of life’….
- At the end of each section of the critical analysis, remember that you need sub headings. “To what extent is my data accurate/representative” and “Link to theoretical context”. This is part of the markscheme and in doing this, you are clearly signposting to the examiner that you have done it. Under each subheading should be a single short paragraph (don’t write too much!
- To what extent is my data accurate/representative – here you briefly critique your sample size/strategy and say why your analysis could be tenuous.
- Link to theoretical context – Here you end your section, by saying “_As seen in my land use map and EQI analysis, it is clear that Goldborne does follow the pattern described in…. Thomas Pikerty’s_ …. So link your findings to the concept you introduced in your introduction. This again can be brief.
- So, there should be 3 sub headings - To what extent is my data accurate/representative and 3 subheadings - Link to theoretical context. one for each of your three hypotheses.

### **Geographical background - essentially displaying knowledge of inequality as a concept, using sources to back it up**

*The choice of Golborne and Brompton and Hans Town as study areas is deliberate, as they represent contrasting socioeconomic profiles within the same borough. This allows for a focused examination of how inequality manifests in areas in close geographical proximity but with vastly different social and economic characteristics. By investigating these wards, the study aims to contribute to the broader understanding of urban inequality and its localised impact*
+ Define and explain (in context additionally)
+ Discuss global spatial variations e.g. North-South divide globally but also in the UK
	+ Within this, touch on the 3 strands of inequality, explaining what inequality in these areas looks like (with evidence)
+ Examine parallel example (preferably a more extreme example, allowing for a captivating transition and focus into my specific place comparison
	*Give context as part of the parallel example so it does not look out of place or like i've talked about it purely for the sake of it - it should be clear throughout that the example is directing the narration towards my specific example*
Bring the focus of the exploration of inequality from global %3E national (UK North-South divide), and then into London, evaluating inequality in London and the corresponding nuances, challenges, limitations etc, before finally shifting the focus towards my specific borough (RBKC) with a captivating, analytical statistic.

### **Geographical Location Justification**
+ personal justification - lived near Grenfell and was actively involved in the post-incident community response > link personal, qualitative experience and narration with compounding statistics and evidence to comprehensively justify the choice of location...
	This should be a multi-level, rigorous, insightful, critical and analytical justification, supporting the decision to choose the RBKC, the 2 specific wards within the borough, and why I chose those wards specifically for comparison.
Monday Lunchtime - Beloe 
### **Introduction Feedback**

> Gini national scale - i'm interested in borough scale

*The decline of areas..+ Grenfell - personal (vested) interest /?
Replace all RBKC with full name at the end

**Location Justification**
*this data not only reaffirms* - answering the question, save some of the maps for the critical analysis 

Spatial variation part should be used in the secondary evidence in answering the hypothesis #

Aims > links > hypothesis and only THEN does it come into the theoretical context
Move "Inequality +++ " to theoretical context 
Start with aims, then link to spec, hypotheses, and t

Parallel example **only a few sentences / 1 para**- a report into inequality found this… (equality trust) - Blackpool
In my report I will see if the same applies  
Maps and justification can be quicker 


### **Literature review** 
After theoretical context, quick table evaluating the sources
Source+Rating+Comment 
Age, bias, political agenda, change over time, 
SEGMENT THEORETICAL CONTEXT 
what is already known - Gaps in existed knowledge, contested thinking etc 

Broken down the theory behind each context / hypothesis. 

Bulk of theory > paragraph for each hypothesis, explain how it impacts the
Report, commentary >> I'm going to test whether that's true, *link to aim + action* > I'm going to find out…

# Methodology Feedback
Very beginning before the table > Add pilot study; tested questionnaire to gauge public perception, gauging risks, 
Maps of where data was recorded 

When, Where, Repeated on, Annotated photos

Full hypothesis not environmental 
Photos not photos - opportunistic sampling (for some), using judgement to try build a representative photos - walked round 100% of streets to ensure spatial representation 
comment about both positive and negative feedbacks

Don't need limitations column > take out but SAVE for evaluation

Index of Decay: Set of instructions that someone can replicate exactly; detail the indicators, exactly HOW, minute detail, 

14 different areas.. to ensure large sample size + sys. samplimg to ensure spatial representation

Location needs to be clear
"SEE APPENDIX > copy of the recording sheet in sections below > ++ annotations 
"Help quantify the features I see"

Sampling justification for IoD > Spatially representative of the whole area 
Stratified AND then systematic > spatial representation?
