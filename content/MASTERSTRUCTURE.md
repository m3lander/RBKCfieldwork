### Hypotheses
1. Environmental Degradation: Golborne has a higher level of environmental degradation than Brompton & Hans Town.
2. Social Deprivation: The level of social deprivation is higher in Golborne than in Brompton and Hans Town.
3. Economic Prosperity: Brompton and Hans Town has a higher level of economic prosperity than Golborne.

### Theoretical Context

#### Economic Prosperity
Quality of life is a multifaceted concept encompassing the general well-being of individuals and societies, including not just wealth and employment but also the built environment, physical and mental health, education, and access to services (Smith, 2020). The increase in income inequality amongst developed countries, especially advanced economies such as the UK and USA, has become increasingly topical and contentious following the 2008 financial crisis (Hudson et al., 2016).

### Geographical Location Justification
The London Borough of Kensington and Chelsea exemplifies stark contrasts in quality of life within a relatively small geographical area. Despite being the wealthiest borough in the UK, it contains some of the most deprived wards alongside areas of extreme affluence (RBKC Council, 2022a).
