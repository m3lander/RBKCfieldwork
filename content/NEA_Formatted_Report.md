## II. Introduction

Quality of life is a multifaceted concept encompassing the general well-being of individuals and societies, including not just wealth and employment but also the built environment, physical and mental health, education, and access to services (Smith, 2020). Inequality refers to the disparities among people in their command over social, economic, and environmental resources (Jones, 2019). These disparities can manifest economically, socially, and environmentally, leading to significant variations in quality of life within urban areas.

The London Borough of Kensington and Chelsea exemplifies stark contrasts in quality of life within a relatively small geographical area. Despite being the wealthiest borough in the UK, it contains some of the most deprived wards alongside areas of extreme affluence (RBKC Council, 2022a). Investigating these disparities is crucial for understanding urban inequality and its implications on residents' lives.

### Research Questions
To what extent does quality of life vary between deprived and affluent wards within the London Borough of Kensington and Chelsea?

### Aims and Objectives
This study aims to investigate the extent to which quality of life varies within the London Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, the most socioeconomically divided borough in England.

In comparing the Golborne ward and the Brompton and Hans Town ward, I will specifically assess and evaluate discrepancies in three key facets of quality of life:
- Social deprivation
- Economic welfare 
- Environmental degradation

This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of intra-urban inequality.

### Hypotheses

1. Environmental Degradation: Golborne has a higher level of environmental degradation than Brompton & Hans Town.
   - Based on theories of environmental justice, which suggest deprived areas often experience poorer environmental conditions (Walker, 2018).

2. Social Deprivation: The level of social deprivation is higher in Golborne than in Brompton and Hans Town.
   - Supported by Bourdieu's theory of social capital, indicating that access to resources differs between social classes (Bourdieu, 1986).

3. Economic Prosperity: Brompton and Hans Town has a higher level of economic prosperity than Golborne.

### Theoretical Context

#### Economic Prosperity
Quality of life is a multifaceted concept encompassing the general well-being of individuals and societies, including not just wealth and employment but also the built environment, physical and mental health, education, and access to services (Smith, 2020). 

Thomas Piketty's (2014) theory of wealth concentration highlights how economic inequality increases when the rate of return on capital exceeds the rate of economic growth, leading to a growing divide between the affluent and deprived. In urban areas like Kensington and Chelsea, this disparity is evident in the extreme differences in property values and income levels. While the affluent ward is expected to benefit from high disposable income, high employment rates, and access to economic opportunities, Golborne is likely to experience significantly higher levels of unemployment, lower income, and greater housing stress.

The increase in income inequality amongst developed countries, especially advanced economies such as the UK and USA, has become increasingly topical and contentious following the 2008 financial crisis (Hudson et al., 2016). Oxfam discovered that in 2015, the richest 62 individuals held the same amount of wealth as the bottom 50% ($1.75 trillion) (Hardoon, Fuentes-Nieva and Ayele, 2016), indicating the disparity in capital distribution and therefore level of economic inequality globally.

#### Social Deprivation
Social deprivation in this investigation will be explored through differences in education, health outcomes, and crime rates between the two wards. Pierre Bourdieu's theory of social capital (1986) provides a useful framework for understanding how access to resources such as education and social networks contributes to the persistence of inequality. In affluent areas, access to elite private schools and better healthcare facilities is much higher, contributing to better social outcomes.

The Coleman Report (1966), a landmark study on educational inequality, provides additional context for understanding how socio-economic background influences educational attainment. This report highlights that socio-economic factors, rather than school resources, determine educational outcomes, which will be particularly relevant when comparing the educational facilities and opportunities in Golborne and Brompton & Hans Town.

#### Environmental Degradation
Environmental justice theory indicates that marginalized communities often experience higher levels of environmental degradation (Walker, 2018), with factors such as lack of green spaces, poor housing conditions, the presence of illegal graffiti and fly-tipping being more prevalent in deprived areas. The Green Space Index Score will provide insights into the accessibility and quality of green spaces in both wards.

Furthermore, urban theories of inequality, such as those developed by David Harvey (1973) and Henri Lefebvre (1991), suggest that urban spaces are often sites of socio-economic exclusion, where capitalist processes of accumulation and development concentrate wealth in specific areas while marginalizing others. Harvey's notion of the "right to the city" argues that urban development benefits the affluent at the expense of the poor, depriving lower-income communities of resources and opportunities.

### Environmental Analysis

#### Urban Decay and Infrastructure
The physical environment shows clear signs of disparity between the two wards:

![Evidence of urban decay](/images/eQh-garage-door-couple-coats-description.jpeg)

*Figure 35: Evidence of urban decay in Golborne*

In Golborne, there are visible indicators of decay:
- Loose wires and graffiti
- Dirty stained walls
- Poor maintenance of buildings
- Less inviting atmosphere in commercial areas

- Damaged ventilation systems
- Higher density of inhabitants
- Presence of rubbish and environmental degradation

![Street infrastructure](/images/AFs-street-cars-parked-description-automatically.jpeg)
