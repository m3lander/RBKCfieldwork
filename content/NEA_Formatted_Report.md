## II. Introduction

Quality of life is a multifaceted concept encompassing the general well-being of individuals and societies, including not just wealth and employment but also the built environment, physical and mental health, education, and access to services (Smith, 2020). Inequality refers to the disparities among people in their command over social, economic, and environmental resources (Jones, 2019). These disparities can manifest economically, socially, and environmentally, leading to significant variations in quality of life within urban areas.

The London Borough of Kensington and Chelsea exemplifies stark contrasts in quality of life within a relatively small geographical area. Despite being the wealthiest borough in the UK, it contains some of the most deprived wards alongside areas of extreme affluence (RBKC Council, 2022a). Investigating these disparities is crucial for understanding urban inequality and its implications on residents' lives.

### Research Questions
To what extent does quality of life vary between deprived and affluent wards within the London Borough of Kensington and Chelsea?

### Aims and Objectives
This study aims to investigate the extent to which quality of life varies within the London Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, the most socioeconomically divided borough in England.

In comparing the Golborne ward and the Brompton and Hans Town ward, I will specifically assess and evaluate discrepancies in three key facets of quality of life:
- Social deprivation
- Economic welfare 
- Environmental degradation

This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of intra-urban inequality.

### Hypotheses

1. Environmental Degradation: Golborne has a higher level of environmental degradation than Brompton & Hans Town.
   - Based on theories of environmental justice, which suggest deprived areas often experience poorer environmental conditions (Walker, 2018).

2. Social Deprivation: The level of social deprivation is higher in Golborne than in Brompton and Hans Town.
   - Supported by Bourdieu's theory of social capital, indicating that access to resources differs between social classes (Bourdieu, 1986).

3. Economic Prosperity: Brompton and Hans Town has a higher level of economic prosperity than Golborne.

### Theoretical Context

#### Economic Prosperity
Quality of life is a multifaceted concept encompassing the general well-being of individuals and societies, including not just wealth and employment but also the built environment, physical and mental health, education, and access to services (Smith, 2020). 

Thomas Piketty's (2014) theory of wealth concentration highlights how economic inequality increases when the rate of return on capital exceeds the rate of economic growth, leading to a growing divide between the affluent and deprived. In urban areas like Kensington and Chelsea, this disparity is evident in the extreme differences in property values and income levels. While the affluent ward is expected to benefit from high disposable income, high employment rates, and access to economic opportunities, Golborne is likely to experience significantly higher levels of unemployment, lower income, and greater housing stress.

The increase in income inequality amongst developed countries, especially advanced economies such as the UK and USA, has become increasingly topical and contentious following the 2008 financial crisis (Hudson et al., 2016). Oxfam discovered that in 2015, the richest 62 individuals held the same amount of wealth as the bottom 50% ($1.75 trillion) (Hardoon, Fuentes-Nieva and Ayele, 2016), indicating the disparity in capital distribution and therefore level of economic inequality globally.

#### Social Deprivation
Social deprivation in this investigation will be explored through differences in education, health outcomes, and crime rates between the two wards. Pierre Bourdieu's theory of social capital (1986) provides a useful framework for understanding how access to resources such as education and social networks contributes to the persistence of inequality. In affluent areas, access to elite private schools and better healthcare facilities is much higher, contributing to better social outcomes.

The Coleman Report (1966), a landmark study on educational inequality, provides additional context for understanding how socio-economic background influences educational attainment. This report highlights that socio-economic factors, rather than school resources, determine educational outcomes, which will be particularly relevant when comparing the educational facilities and opportunities in Golborne and Brompton & Hans Town.

#### Environmental Degradation
Environmental justice theory indicates that marginalized communities often experience higher levels of environmental degradation (Walker, 2018), with factors such as lack of green spaces, poor housing conditions, the presence of illegal graffiti and fly-tipping being more prevalent in deprived areas. The Green Space Index Score will provide insights into the accessibility and quality of green spaces in both wards.

Furthermore, urban theories of inequality, such as those developed by David Harvey (1973) and Henri Lefebvre (1991), suggest that urban spaces are often sites of socio-economic exclusion, where capitalist processes of accumulation and development concentrate wealth in specific areas while marginalizing others. Harvey's notion of the "right to the city" argues that urban development benefits the affluent at the expense of the poor, depriving lower-income communities of resources and opportunities.

## V. Conclusions and Evaluation

### Overall Conclusion: Quality of Life Variation

The compiled primary and secondary data analyzed clearly demonstrates that significant inequality exists between Brompton & Hans Town (BHT) and Golborne Road (GR) wards across environmental, economic, and social dimensions, substantially impacting residents' daily lives.

Despite their close proximity and shared presence in the same borough, this investigation reveals profound inequalities on a local scale, highlighting the pervasiveness of inequality in a city as wealthy as London - notable given that London has the highest median income within the UK before housing costs (Harari and McGuinness, 2019).

The clear pockets of deprivation alongside extreme wealth found in this investigation suggest:
1. The likelihood of this pattern of inequality playing out on a more regional scale in London
2. Similar patterns potentially existing on a national scale (North-South divide)
3. That inequality remains endemic even in small sections of affluent London, rather than being:
   - A feature of the past
   - Limited to developing countries
   - Restricted to areas traditionally depicted as deprived

#### Economic Inequality Findings
Economic analysis reveals substantial disparities between the wards:

1. Property Ownership:
   - BHT residents 14x more likely to own multiple properties
   - 42% of BHT residents own second homes vs 3% in Golborne
   - Property ownership rates reflect significant wealth concentration

2. Service and Price Disparities:
   - Basic services show marked price differences (e.g., haircuts 4x higher in BHT)
   - Clear market segmentation between wards
   - Service quality and availability reflects economic divide

#### Evaluation of Methods Table

| Method title | Why valid method | Drawbacks | How reliable results and conclusion | Any changes? potential modifications to increase validity |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Annotated photos | This is a valid method as by using this qualitative method, the data is visually engaging and simple, with my annotations ensuring that key indicators of inequality are highlighted and clear. | Daily external environmental factors could alter perceptions. Weather conditions and seasonal timing (autumn) may contribute to negative perceptions due to leaf litter and puddles. Limited sample size due to systematic sampling may have missed relevant features. | Reliability demonstrated through direct control of photo selection and recent, up-to-date documentation. Increased validity of analysis and conclusions through contemporary evidence. | Could have captured photos at similar weather conditions to reduce external factor bias. |
| Index of decay survey | Valid approach to exploring inequality through assessment of property decay and damage. Scoring system and multiple indicators enabled comprehensive comparison. | Subjective scoring system treats all indicators equally (e.g., "peeling paint" vs "boarded up windows"). External conditions affect visibility of indicators. | Reasonable reliability despite subjectivity due to same-day data collection for both wards, minimizing external influences. | Could enlist multiple observers for more comprehensive results. |
| EQI | Valid method with tailored indicators and comparable rating system. | Environmental quality rankings are subjective and dependent on collection time, investigator mood, and weather conditions. | Reliable despite subjectivity due to same-day collection. Minimized external influence impact. | Could involve multiple observers and repeat surveys across different seasons/times. |
| Crime survey | Enables understanding of both perceived and actual crime through statistical and experiential data. | Potential underreporting and demographic variations in crime reporting. | Reliable but could be improved through comparison with official statistics and anonymous reporting. | Could segregate survey by demographics and implement digital reporting. |
| High street services survey | Systematic approach to understanding service distribution and economic infrastructure. | Doesn't capture service quality or accessibility factors. | Reliable for service mapping but could benefit from qualitative community feedback. | Could integrate accessibility assessment and community perspectives. |
| Local Business Retail Price Index survey | Quantitative method reduces subjectivity in understanding economic disparities. | Temporal price fluctuations not accounted for; limited product representation. | Could improve reliability through standardized product selection and broader economic context. | Could expand product range and incorporate qualitative economic experience data. |
