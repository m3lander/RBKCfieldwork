# Introduction ? AIMS, LINKS TO SPEC, HYPOTHESIS > NO SPIEL

Quality of life is a multifaceted concept encompassing the general well-being of individuals and societies, including not just wealth and employment but also the built environment, physical and mental health, education, and access to services (Smith, 2020). Inequality refers to the disparities among people in their command over social, economic, and environmental resources (Jones, 2019). These disparities can manifest economically, socially, and environmentally, leading to significant variations in quality of life within urban areas.

The London Borough of Kensington and Chelsea exemplifies stark contrasts in quality of life within a relatively small geographical area. Despite being the wealthiest borough in the UK, it contains some of the most deprived wards alongside areas of extreme affluence (RBKC Council, 2022a). Investigating these disparities is crucial for understanding urban inequality and its implications on residents' lives.

The increase in income inequality amongst developed countries, especially advanced economies such as the UK and USA, has become increasingly topical and contentious following the 2008 financial crisis (Hudson et al., 2016) as Oxfam discovered that in 2015, the richest 62 individuals held the same amount of wealth as the bottom 50% ($1.75 trillion) (Hardoon, Fuentes-Nieva and Ayele, 2016) indicating the disparity in capital distribution and therefore level of economic inequality globally.

income before housing costs (?662) (Harari and McGuinness, 2019), this fails to account for the massive inequality present not just between different London boroughs, but also within a single borough.

This study focuses on two wards within the borough: Golborne, identified as one of the most deprived areas and the ground-zero of the Grenfell Fire Tragedy, and Brompton & Hans Town, renowned for its luxurious offerings and affluence. By comparing these wards, the investigation aims to assess the extent to which quality of life varies within Kensington and Chelsea.

## Aims of Study

 This study aims to investigate the extent to which quality of life varies within the London Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, the most socioeconomically divided borough in England.  \
In comparing the Golborne ward and the Brompton and Hans Town ward, I will specifically assess and evaluate discrepancies in three key facets of quality of life; social deprivation, economic welfare and environmental degradation. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of intra-urban inequality. \
 \


To guide this investigation, three main hypotheses have been formulated:

## Hypotheses

**1. Brompton and Hans Town has a higher level of economic prosperity than Golborne.**

**2****. Golborne has a higher level of environmental degradation than Brompton and Hans Town. \
**        - This is based on theories of environmental justice, which suggest deprived areas often experience poorer environmental conditions (Walker, 2018).

**3. The level of social deprivation is higher in Golborne than in Brompton and Hans Town.**

- Supported by Bourdieu's theory of social capital, indicating that access to resources differs between social classes (Bourdieu, 1986).


These hypotheses will be tested through a combination of primary and secondary data collection methods. Primary data will include environmental quality and index of decay surveys, photographic evidence accompanied by qualitative annotations, and perception of crime surveys.

Secondary data will be sourced from government statistics, local council reports, and academic literature. The study will employ both qualitative and quantitative approaches to ensure a comprehensive analysis of the inequality present in these two wards.

## Theoretical Context \
*++What is already known? Contested thinking? Possible or existing gaps in current knowledge,* \


**Economic Prosperity** \
The concept of economic inequality is central to this investigation and will be assessed through indicators such as income distribution, housing affordability, and employment rates. Thomas Piketty?s (2014) theory of wealth concentration highlights how economic inequality increases when the rate of return on capital exceeds the rate of economic growth, leading to a growing divide between the affluent and deprived. In urban areas like Kensington and Chelsea, this disparity is evident in the extreme differences in property values and income levels. While the affluent ward is expected to benefit from high disposable income, high employment rates, and access to economic opportunities, Golborne is likely to experience significantly higher levels of unemployment, lower income, and greater housing stress. The Gini Coefficient and the Index of Multiple Deprivation will be utilised to quantify income inequality and provide a statistical measure of economic disparity (Gini,1921).

**Social Deprivation**

Social deprivation in this investigation will be explored through differences in education, health outcomes, and crime rates between the two wards. Pierre Bourdieu?s theory of social capital (1986) provides a useful framework for understanding how access to resources such as education and social networks contributes to the persistence of inequality. In affluent areas, access to elite private schools and better healthcare facilities is much higher, contributing to better social outcomes. This contrasts with deprived wards, where schools are often underfunded, and healthcare facilities are less accessible. The Coleman Report (1966), a landmark study on educational inequality, will provide additional context for understanding how socio-economic background influences educational attainment. This report highlights that socio-economic factors, rather than school resources, determine educational outcomes, which will be particularly relevant when comparing the educational facilities and opportunities in Golborne and Brompton & Hans Town.

### Coleman Report Modern >>

**Environmental Degradation**

Environmental justice theory indicates that marginalised communities often experience higher levels of environmental degradation (Walker, 2018), with factors such as lack of green spaces, poor housing conditions, the presence of illegal graffiti and fly-tipping being more prevalent in deprived areas. The Green Space Index Score will provide insights into the accessibility and quality of green spaces in both wards.

**Urban Theories of Inequality**

 \
This investigation draws on several other socio-economic and geographical theories, ensuring my investigation is structured upon a well-documented foundation. This is imperative in avoiding a superficial, assumptive investigation and will allow me to gain a nuanced and insightful understanding of the mechanisms driving quality of life disparities and inequality in the borough.

The Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) will be a key tool in assessing levels of deprivation across different domains, including income, employment, health, and environment.

Bourdieu?s theory of cultural capital will also be applied to understand how disparities in education and social mobility contribute to broader inequalities. Bourdieu argued that cultural capital; such as education, intellect, and social networks, plays a crucial role in maintaining and reproducing social inequalities. This theory is especially relevant in Kensington and Chelsea, where access to private schools and cultural institutions varies widely between affluent and deprived areas.

Furthermore, urban theories of inequality, such as those developed by David Harvey (1973) and Henri Lefebvre (1991), suggest that urban spaces are often sites of socio-economic exclusion, where capitalist processes of accumulation and development concentrate wealth in specific areas while marginalising others. Harvey's notion of the "right to the city" argues that urban development benefits the affluent at the expense of the poor, depriving lower-income communities of resources and opportunities. This idea will help frame the investigation's exploration of how inequality is spatially manifested in the built environment of Kensington and Chelsea.

Urban inequality is far from unique to London, with other UK cities luke Blackpool also exhibiting significant disparities within a single urban area.  To understand the extent to which high crime rates, poor housing and environmental conditions **contribute to disparities in Quality of Life between residents of different socioeconomic backgrounds, I?ll ?** whether Blackpool provides an example of such **geospatial inequality**** which I hypothesise to also be the case within the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea Despite its reputation as a popular seaside resort, Blackpool faces significant challenges related to deprivation and inequality. According to the 2019 English Indices of Deprivation, Blackpool is the most deprived local authority in England (Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government, 2019). Life expectancy varies by up to 13 years between its most and least deprived areas (Blackpool Council, 2021), highlighting stark health inequalities. This overall ranking masks even more extreme variations at a smaller scale, with some neighbourhoods in Blackpool experiencing levels of deprivation that are among the highest in the country, while other areas remain relatively affluent.

Educational attainment also reflects a clear disparity, with students from disadvantaged backgrounds significantly underperforming compared to their peers from more affluent areas (Department for Education, 2020).  From an economical view, while some parts of Blackpool benefit from the tourism industry, others suffer from high unemployment rates and low-wage seasonal work. These economic disparities are reflected in the housing market, with some areas characterised by poor quality, overcrowded housing, while others feature well-maintained properties and higher property values. This example underscores how profound disparities in quality of life can exist within a relatively small geographical area, a pattern which I will seek to investigate within the borough of Kensington and Chelsea and seek to understand the similarities and differences between factors driving disparities in quality of life. \

## Geographical Location Justification

The selection of Golborne and Brompton and Hans Town is intentional, as they represent starkly contrasting socioeconomic profiles within the same borough. This allows for a focused examination of how inequality manifests in areas in close geographical proximity but with vastly different social and economic characteristics.

The Golborne Ward is ranked among the top 10% most deprived areas nationally according to the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) (Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government, 2019) and exhibits substantially higher *** unemployment rates, lower average incomes, and reduced access to quality housing and services (RBKC Council, 2022b).

My decision to select the Golborne ward for my comparative investigation was in part influenced by the rich opportunity to evaluate the socio-spatial processes contributing to deprivation. However, when comparing it to an affluent ward, it will be essential to explore how different urban planning, investment, and community development strategies shape life outcomes. The study of such contrasting areas can provide insight into whether policies aimed at reducing inequality are effective, or if the disparity continues to grow.

In justifying the choice of Golborne ward, the focus on **income deprivation affecting children** offers a compelling case. Deprivation disproportionately affecting younger populations speaks to broader intergenerational issues and raises questions about long-term urban policy effectiveness. A potential approach could be to investigate whether initiatives targeting child poverty, such as educational support or welfare programmes, have mitigated the disparity between wards.

The map illustrates the proportion of children aged 0-15 living in income-deprived households. In Kensington and Chelsea, **24 LSOAs** are ranked among the **top 20% most deprived** in England, primarily clustered in the **northern borough**, particularly near the **Hammersmith and Fulham borders**. Conversely, **38 LSOAs** are in the **top 20% least deprived**, predominantly in southern, more affluent areas.

In justifying the choice of Golborne ward the focus on **income deprivation affecting children** offers a compelling case. Deprivation disproportionately affecting younger populations hints at to broader intergenerational issues and raises questions about long-term urban policy effectiveness. A potential approach could be to investigate whether initiatives targeting child poverty, such as educational support or welfare programmes, have mitigated the disparity between wards.

**Child Wellbeing Index (CWI) 2009 ? Child-Specific Deprivation**

The **Child Wellbeing Index (CWI)**, developed as part of a government initiative to assess deprivation among different population groups, ranks neighbourhoods based on seven domains: health, material wellbeing, education, crime, housing, environment, and children in need.  \
The CWI allows me to build a more nuanced understanding of deprivation beyond simple income measures, factoring in broader quality-of-life indicators that directly impact children. In Kensington and Chelsea areas ranking in the **top quintile** for child deprivation are likely to suffer from issues like overcrowding, poor housing conditions, and limited access to services, all of which can significantly hinder child development. \

Child deprivation correlates closely with long-term social mobility challenges, as children in deprived areas tend to face compounded obstacles throughout the course of their life. This statistic aligns with existing theoretical context on the ?poverty trap? in urban environments, where socio-economic conditions in childhood heavily influence future opportunities.

## Methodology

# Data presentation & analysis

### Economic - Brompton and Hans Town has a higher level of economic prosperity than Golborne. \
Multiple home ownership

### 
![](/images/GPT_Image_10.png)

*Figure 10 Bar chart looking at the proportion of residents who own multiple properties (**[www.ons.gov.uk](www.ons.gov.uk)**, n.d.)*

The ability to own multiple homes, with one located in London (which ranked fourth most expensive city globally in 2023 (McCarthy), is a clear indicator of wealth. Consequently, the fact that individuals in BHT are 14 times more likely to own multiple properties compared to those living in GR highlights the significant economic inequality between these wards. Moreover, GR is comparable to the household average, with only 3% of UK households owning a second home (GOV.UK, 2022), demonstrating the limited percentage of the population that can afford such a level of house ownership and thus the 42% rate of second-home ownership in BHT reinforces this recurring notion of wealth inequality. Evidence supporting this observation extends beyond demonstrating economic inequality in that it evidences how this disparity can further exacerbate inequality - the rising rates of home ownership have led to a decrease in overall wealth distribution (Maclennan, 2023). Additionally, the unequitable distribution of home ownership can have adverse repercussions, such as displacing local residents and creating a negative multiplier effect where these properties are not always occupied by residents who contribute to local businesses and services.

```
Despite a lack of overall initial pattern in this figure, the data presented still exemplifies economic inequalities between BHT and G. The absence of any ?vacant shops/businesses? in BHT support this, as a vacant street suggests both economic stagnancy and lack of competition/desire for businesses to set up. This is reinforced visually in ?figure? due to GR having 5 ?vacant shops/businesses?, - the fact that this scores joint 3rd for the highest tally count implies a lack of consumer spending power, with locals lacking the disposable income to support  local businesses and thus limited business opportunities as there is a reluctance for shops to set up (negative multiplier effect). This could also be symptomatic of high levels of crime (explored later in my crime survey), as these businesses could have experienced financial losses and have been forced to close down. Moreover, the lack of ?pawn shops? in BHT in comparison to 3 in GR indicates economic wealth, as the market for a pawn shop suggests a market for people needing to sell off possessions when short of cash ? something which is less likely to be occurring in BHT (reinforced by ?figure zyx? which addresses economic inequality. One of the most striking data samples I collected was the number of ?high-end retail stores?, as well as ?organic food/ingredient shops? in BHT compared to 0 in GR. This underscores the affluence of BHT residents, further demonstrating the extent to which economic inequality is pervasive. Additionally, the ?organic food/ingredient shops? is also suggestive that those on BHT have more income, time, and energy to invest into their health (reflected by this health-conscious consumerism) implying that this economic inequality has ramifications for health and therefore is a confounding factor in contributing to social inequality. In addition, the data for number of ?laundrettes? (5 for GR) is indicative of the level of income deprivation in Golborne as the high market demand for laundrettes shows that some are  unable to afford home appliances such as washing machines, whereas BHT residents are likely to have both multiple washing machines, and in many cases, the means to pay staff to do their washing for them.(?figure xyz?).

**Discrepancy in prices of select goods and services**

*Figure 11 Bar chart looking at % difference in prices of select goods and services*

![](/images/9MB_Image_12.png)

*Figure 12 Bar chart looking at the average price and % difference between Golborne and Brompton & Hans Town*

The significant differences in the average prices of common goods and services between Golborne and Brompton & Hans Town are clear indicators of economic inequality, as the cost of living is directly linked to residents' purchasing power and overall quality of life. For instance, the price of a basic men's haircut in Brompton & Hans Town (?32.00) is nearly four times higher than in Golborne (?8.50), highlighting a substantial disparity in service costs that could affect affordability for residents of lower economic means.

The higher cost of leisure activities and amenities in Brompton & Hans Town further emphasise these economic disparities. A gym membership averages ?60.00 per month in the affluent ward, almost triple the ?22.00 average in Golborne. This disparity is less telling in regard to Golborne residents as it is that of Brompton and Hans Town residents? both willing and able to pay premium ?

is reflective of the lower income level in Golborne, and while the lower average price means these gyms are more affordable, potentially impacting their health and well-being. W Moreover, the cost of a meal at a pizzeria is ?25.00 in Brompton & Hans Town versus ?12.00 in Golborne, indicating that dining out is considerably more expensive and thus less accessible to individuals with limited financial resources. However, those with limited disposable income .

- shows that although higher cost of living in BHT, can be attributed to fact that ppl in this area are willing and able to afford these prices (lets find a stat) - prices out poorer residents

- Huge $ diff in meal of pizzeria + bread loaf could suggest differing qualities of ingredients and produce - diff demands + expectations for diff qualities of produce???

- If were to redo this aspect of investigation, could investigate/ask abt at quality of ingredients used for both, where they are sourced etc (even whether that is listed as smth on packaging/mennu etc- ie is that smth customers value (likely in BHT))

**ANNOTATED PHOTOGRAPHS:**

I annotated these photographs with key visual indicators to indicate the value of the economic assets on each street.

![A street with cars parked on it

Description automatically generated](/images/tBQ-street-cars-parked-description-automatically.png)

*Figure 13  Brompton & Hans Town*

```
The many windows in the grand stucco fronted house that is central to the image are far larger than the majority of those in Golborne Road. This is significant as large windows are desirable and signify wealth, indicating the value of the properties in this area. 

Moreover, the sheer scale of this house (4 storeys and 3 windows wide, combined with tall rooms) demonstrates their grandeur and monetary value, reinforced by the fact that this house was last sold in 2017 for ?7.5m. Added details such as a doric porch and a balustraded balcony emphasise this. 

Furthermore, the well-pruned trees on the first floor balcony not only contribute to the high EQS score for this area, but they also indicate that the homeowners have the time and money (disposable income) to maintain these plants ? a feature clearly less prevalent in Golborne Road as shown by their relevant photos. 

```

*Figure 14  Brompton & Hans Town laser eye clinic store front*

```
The fact that the signage on this window for a laser eye clinic is in 3 languages other than English (Russian, Chinese, Arabic) highlights a diverse international crowd that reside in this area as this specific marketing is appealing to a clientele of wealthy elite migrants. This suggests that this clientele whom have the means to afford this surgery are attracted to/are present in this area. The theme of this attracting wealthy clientele in this area who have much disposable income is reinforced by the fact that on the website the price is apparently ?from ?2,000 per eye?.

```
The uniform appearance of the housing on this street suggests that much care (and time and money) is put into maintaining this presentation, illustrated by the matching pruned trees and smart iron railings. Furthermore, the wealth of this street is emphasised by the cleanliness of the street in figure 15 (as residents perhaps have more money to invest in their area). Moreover, in the window in figure 16, evidence of security presence (CCTV signage) shows residents can afford high level of private security infrastructure, and have valuable assets (there is also a ring doorbell and a red alarm in front of house).

*Figure 17  Brompton & Hans Town: Waitrose*

```
The presence of exotic potted plants and green foliage outside this Waitrose highlights how they can afford this to entice customers who feel they belong in this type of supermarket, creating a sense of order and cleanliness, reinforced by the huge windows, even paintwork, and glass doors. The fancy building for just a supermarket (it is a 180 year old building within the Duke of Westminster?s Grosvenor Estate) illustrates a sense of the type (and wealth) of clientele who visit this shop, furth exacerbated by the ornate detailing of the architecture by the windows.

*Figures 18,19,20  Brompton & Hans Town private garden*

```
These photos are capturing Cadogan Place Gardens ? private communal gardens intended only for Cadogan residents. These are clearly well-maintained neat gardens, with clean well-looked after paths, and spanning 3.5 hectares - a huge amount of land considering the price of land in this part of London. furthermore, the grandeur of these gardens and sense of wealth is further demonstrated by the royal signage, as well as the clear repeated emphasis on the privacy of these gardens (CCTV warnings, a set of rules, and the fact a key card is needed to enter). Moreover, the fact that these gardens contain an entire water garden and multiple tennis courts clearly highlights the extent of the wealth of these residents, who clearly have great access to beautiful, private, and well-maintained green spaces - something that is not present for the majority of Golborne Road ward residents.

*Figure 21 Brompton & Hans Town embassy*

```
The Ecuadorian embassy is depicted in this image, occupying a smart red brick Edwardian building. Embassies are often found in the most exclusive/wealthy parts of London as they are safer, desirable, have good police presence, and nice buildings, demonstrated by the well-maintained exterior and abundance of windows - something that is often seen as a status symbol. Furthermore, there is a huge security presence with multiple CCTV cameras and iron railings barricading the entrance, thus illustrating the value and importance of these buildings and their residents. Moreover, the clean even brickwork and absence of graffiti is a stark contrast with the later analysed images taken in Golborne Road ward.

```
The grand and wealthy architecture style found in this ward is further reiterated by this image, illustrated by the presence of balconies, even paintwork, and clean porches, hinting at the disposable income of the residents who are able to afford both these buildings and their upkeep. Moreover, the roads are smooth, clean, and wide, creating an open and safe environment. Moreover, barred windows add to the aforementioned idea of a high security presence, indicating the ability of the people living here to afford this, and their desire to protect valuable possessions.

*Figures 23 and 24  Brompton & Hans Town shop fronts*

```
These two photos highlight the presence of specialist niche shops/buildings targeted for a specific wealthy market found in this ward - people on an average salary unlikely to shop here or be able afford to shop here. The Map House in figure 23 is London?s oldest specialist antique map dealer, designated for wealthy collectors. Moreover, Gladwell & Patterson, the internationally renowned art gallery in figure 24 has been granted various Royal Warrants in its time by multiple monarchs, highlighting its grandeur. Moreover, it was founded in 1746, and thus 
clearly makes enough profit to have been around so long. Furthermore, it is thus arguably situated in good proximity to wealthy people, as a shop as niche as this would be unlikely to succeed as a business in an area like Golborne Road as later shown by the typical shops found on the streets in that ward.
```
![](/images/sKq_Image_26.png)

*Figures 25, 26, 27  Brompton & Hans Town shop fronts*

```
There is also clearly a high presence of designer shops with attractive storefronts to entice customers, with Love Luxury in figure 25 selling things such as designer bags, watches, and jewellery, thus revealing their wealthy local clientele. Moreover, according to the website of Pacha of London (the watch shop in figure 26), ?Pacha of London have established a well respected reputation of selling superb quality, rare and collectable timepieces & diamonds?, thus reiterating this point. This is further reinforced by Bella Ling in figure 27- yet another luxury clothing outlet. Thus, it is clear that these shops are targeted to extremely wealthy people, with these designer items being far out of the budget of an average salary. Thus, the apparent success and abundance of luxury/designer shops is indicative of the wealth found in this area.

This photo depicts a typical high street found in this area, as despite the poor weather, the photo has a welcoming and friendly atmosphere ? reinforced by the EQS score of this area. Moreover, the flag bunting perhaps suggests an attempt to appeal to diverse and international residents. Furthermore, the clean pavements devoid of litter is a stark contrast to many streets found in Golborne Road, further emphasising this environmental quality inequality.

In this photo there is a large presence of London Black Cabs, something which is a classic ?symbol? associated with the UK. The fact they are waiting for clients suggests that they are regularly used by wealthy shoppers on this street, as they charge more than other cab companies such as Uber, and are thus seen as more of a luxury. Furthermore, the building in these photos houses Harrods ? a quintessential British department store known for its luxurious costly products and  wealthy clients, a stark contrast with the stores found in Golborne Road ward. The presence of a doorman in uniform reinforces this, illustrating the high level of customer service that is expected by shoppers, and how the department store is wealthy enough to afford to employ for this sort of work.

The brutalist architecture of Trellick tower, a grade 2 listed tower block containing much social housing (apartments) immediately demonstrates far less architectural uniformity as was depicted in the images of Brompton & Hans Town ward.

**Index of urban decay:**

![](/images/cja_Image_54.png)

*Figure 56 Bar chart looking at the comparison of average index of urban decay scores*

```
The lack of data present in ?figure? for average index of urban decay scores for BHT is a result of the fact that when I recorded this data, there was no indicators of urban decay for the indicators of ?displaced roof material?, ?significant structural damage?, and ?rotting timber/rusted material?. In comparison, GR has minimum 6 for its average score in ?figure?. This demonstrates the differences in environmental quality for both streets, by not only suggesting that BHT receives better maintenance, but also that perhaps their buildings are made of more quality materials (reinforced by my photos and ?figure? that looks at house prices). This better maintenance could be linked to the economic wealth present in BHT, as the fact that they likely have greater disposable wealth allows them to have more capital to invest back into their living area. In turn, this can arguably better their quality of life by providing them with less stress about their living situation. This stress is reinforced by the fact that the aforementioned indicators which BHT scores an average 0 for are all prominent and suggestive of both a far greater visual sense of urban decay, but also potential unsafe living conditions (?rotting timber?, ?significant structural damage? etc). This is a flaw of my data collection and presentation method, as the  layout of my bar chart (?figure?) suggests that each indicator is valued equally in terms of the level of urban decay, however it?s arguably wrong to equalise ?peeling paint? and ?displaced roof material? as equal indicators, as ?displaced roof material? is far more problematic and likely to affect local?s daily lives and affect their mental state. Thus, if I were to redo this survey, I would choose to measure both the frequency and the degree of urban decay.

*Figure 59 Map of Access to Green Space for Golborne & Swinbrook (Friends of the Earth, n.d.) - not to scale*

The data in both maps from ?Friends of the Earth? provides in-depth data surrounding the access to green space that both streets have. Surprisingly, Hans Town and Brompton scores the lowest rating of E (?neighbourhoods that are the most deprived of green space, including gardens and parks), with the average garden area per person being 8m2, and average public green space per person being 0m2. In comparison, Golborne and Swinbrook scores a green space rating of D, with the average garden area being 5m2 , and the average public green space per person being 30m2. It is clear that in terms of the local environment, HBT is suffering far more in terms of access to public green space, thus going against my hypothesis. However, this can be explained by...

Horniman?s Pleasant Park ? 15 year old shot dead whereas BHT they have comm. Squares and private green spaces in addition to (small) gardens and/or Hyde Park

While Golborne is shown to have a higher Green Space Rating (D) than BHT (E), I suspect that this is somewhat anomalous and is a result of the extensive green space that is the Kensal Green cemetery being included in the data ? \
Less garden PP, photos of cemetery, Meanwhile Gardens, JHP and canal pathways; in reality the green space is ?

In addition to this, Holborne does score an average 3m2 extra per person for average garden area (and this is supplemented by private gardens), displaying not only that HBT residents are likely to have bigger gardens, but also that they are therefore more able to afford this luxury. Furthermore, despite HBT being closer to the city centre (where property/land prices get higher) which should suggest that gardens get smaller (find data to back up), the data highlights how they in fact still have bigger gardens than those in GR, demonstrating the power of their wealth. Moreover, an explanation for my weaker findings from this source of data (and a weakness of these maps) is that it is an average for a wide area (rather than looking at more individual streets), so is less specific - it being an average can conceal inequalities within the area.

## Social - The level of social deprivation is higher in Golborne than in Brompton and Hans Town.

### Crime Survey Analysis

As part of my investigation into urban inequality and discrepancies of quality of life within the London Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, I conducted a crime survey to examine the disparity in crime levels between GR and BHT. My survey focused on visually observable crime indicators, which I categorised into two distinct tables: (1) ?Comparison of Crime Indicators between Wards? and (2) ?Comparison of Crime Prevention Indicators between Wards.? This segmentation is crucial as it reflects not only the occurrence of criminal activity but also the measures taken to prevent crime, which I hypothesized would differ between the two economically diverse wards.

The results from the ?Comparison of Crime Indicators? table show that Golborne is disproportionately affected by higher levels of visible crime, including vandalism, graffiti, and littering which aligns with my initial hypothesis regarding the correlation between inner-city deprivation and elevated crime rates. This supports the broader concept that socially and economically deprived areas generally experience more visible signs of crime due to a combination of lower investment in public infrastructure, greater societal tensions, and often overwhelmed local law enforcement capabilities. However, a notable limitation of this survey is the reliance on visual confirmation of crime, which inherently conceals more insidious types of criminal activity (e.g., drug trafficking, domestic violence) that are less observable during a street survey.

To address this limitation, I will incorporate secondary data from the Metropolitan Police to gain a more comprehensive understanding of crime trends in both wards. This secondary data will provide insight into the types of crime that are not immediately visible, allowing for a more comprehensive evaluation of the crime disparities between the two areas. This will serve to both triangulate my findings, especially within areas that suffer from high levels of a particular crime, but also strengthen the validity of my analysis by incorporating official crime reports. This will assist me in reducing the bias introduced by the visual nature of the primary data collection method, which has the potential to exacerbate harmful stereotypes, counter-intuitive to my investigation,.

**Crime Prevention Indicators**

The data gathered from the ?Comparison of Crime Prevention Indicators? reveals an interesting pattern in terms of security measures in both wards. GR shows a higher frequency of deterrents such as security fencing, theft prevention signs, and behaviour enforcement signs, indicating a heightened need for such preventative actions in response to elevated crime levels. This could reflect the broader urban theory suggesting that deprived areas implement reactive measures to mitigate crime due to a combination of higher crime rates and lower social cohesion. QUESTION ? needlessly articulate / wordy and/or too superficial / lacking in evidence?

On the other hand, BHT, despite its status as an affluent ward, surprisingly recorded a higher ?average number of CCTV cameras per road.? At first glance this anomaly contradicts my hypothesis that BHT would have fewer signs of crime prevention due to a lower prevalence of crime. However, this discrepancy can be explained by the nature of CCTV ownership. While a significant portion of CCTV cameras in Golborne were located on public property, those in BHT were largely installed by private homeowners. **PIE CHART TO SHOW RESIDENTIAL VS COMMERCIAL / PUBLIC CCTV > ADD TO METHODOLOGY** This highlights an important socio-economic factor: the ability to afford and invest in private crime prevention technology.

The prevalence of privately owned security devices in BHT points to the unequal distribution of crime prevention measures across constituency, council a lines. In contrast to GR, where crime prevention is more reliant on publicly funded infrastructure (e.g., council-installed cameras), BHT residents have the financial means to safeguard their homes through the purchase and maintenance of private security systems. This observation reinforces (my) **if I can hypothesise earlier** link between economic capital and crime prevention, suggesting that affluence enables residents to actively reduce their exposure and vulnerability to crime through personal investment, thus further entrenching spatial inequalities.

Thus, the ?average number of CCTV cameras per road,? while a potential reflection of security concerns, also serves as an indicator of economic inequality. *Perpetuating cycle > wealthier individuals can insulatate themselves *

*According to the Trust for London, the royal borough of Kensington and Chelsea (ROYAL BOROUGH OF KENSINGTON & CHELSEA) has a poverty rate of 29%, compared to the average London borough of 27%, and income deprivation of 0.7 (relative to London overall). However, **these numbers are skewed? **	 **risks hiding?**? As while the child poverty rate is 10% lower than both the London Borough average of 33% and the England average of 31%, the three wards in the North of the borough have higher rates of child poverty than both the London* and national averages, reaching as high as 57% in some wards.

### IMD:

*Figures 65 and 66 Two OS maps comparing % of households in different IMD deprivation deciles (**[www.ons.gov.uk](www.ons.gov.uk)** n.d.) *

The IMD looks at a number of broad themes, including income, employment, education, health, crime, barriers to housing and services, and the living environment. (Consumer Data Research Centre, 2020), thus providing a composite and accurate way to compare social inequality between HBT and GR. As a result, the fact that GR falls into the most deprived decile clearly highlights the scale of deprivation on multiple levels present in this area. This is a stark comparison to the colours found in the second map. 
Anomaly in BHT is due to the housing estate
Because CDRC looks at OA (output areas), not specific wards, so has skewed the data ? but even so, GR still far more deprived

However, limitations of this data are the fact that census maps divide up areas of London into OAs (Output Areas), which are the lowest level of geographical area for census statistics, which generally follow ward boundaries. As a result, OAs are made up of between 40-250 households with resident populations between 100-625. By being by area rather than by individual street or household, the data for each OA could thus conceal inequalities. This could mean that specific households in BHT that score highly on the IMD actually score much lower individually, but other households in the same OA lower the average (the housing estate), thus potentially skewing the comparison.

## >> Conclusion

These price disparities are indicative of the broader economic inequality between the two wards. According to the Cost of Living Theory (Engel, 1857), households with higher incomes tend to spend more on goods and services, driving up prices in affluent areas due to increased demand and the ability to pay premium prices. This creates an environment where only the wealthiest individuals can afford to reside comfortably, which exacerbates socio-economic segregation.

Furthermore, the Spatial Inequality Framework suggests that such economic disparities within close geographic proximity can lead to social stratification and reduced social cohesion (Smith, 2011). Residents of lower-income areas may experience limited access to high-quality goods and services, which has the added effect of reinforcing cycles of poverty and limiting opportunities for upward mobility.

The data clearly evidences disparities in child poverty between Brompton & Hans Town (BHT) and Golborne, which provides evidence of entrenched social inequality. It?s interesting to note, however, that neither Golborne nor Brompton and Hans Town claim the spot for highest and lowest number of children living in benefit claimant households respectively, with BHT enjoying the 4th lowest number while Dalgarno and Notting Dale both top Golborne with the highest and lowest number of children li The stacked bar chart demonstrates that Golborne has approximately 395 children living in out-of-work benefit claimant households, representing 90.8% of the total children in such circumstances between the two wards, while BHT accounts for just 40 children (9.2%). This dramatic disparity aligns with Bourdieu's (1986) theory of social reproduction, whereby socioeconomic disadvantages tend to perpetuate across generations within specific geographical areas.

The age distribution data is particularly telling, with Golborne showing significantly higher numbers across all age brackets, but especially in the 5-15 age range. This concentration of child poverty during crucial developmental years supports Wilson's (1987) concept of neighborhood effects, where geographical concentration of disadvantage can amplify negative outcomes. Research by the Nuffield Foundation (2021) indicates that children exposed to poverty during these formative years are significantly more likely to experience limited social mobility and reduced life chances, creating what Townsend terms an "intergenerational transmission of deprivation."

However, limitations exist in this dataset's interpretation. The out-of-work benefits metric alone may not capture the full spectrum of child poverty, as it excludes households experiencing in-work poverty or those just above the benefit threshold. Additionally, the data represents a static snapshot and doesn't reflect the dynamic nature of household circumstances or seasonal variations in employment patterns. Following the Spatial Inequality Framework (Smith, 2011), this concentration of child poverty in such close geographic proximity to areas of extreme affluence may exacerbate social tensions and further reduce opportunities for social cohesion between the two wards.

This extreme polarization in child poverty rates between two adjacent wards exemplifies what Harvey (1973) describes as the "spatial concentration of disadvantage" - where social inequalities become physically embedded in urban geography, creating distinct pockets of deprivation that can persist across generations.
