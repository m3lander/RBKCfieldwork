# NEA Project Handoff Report

## Project Overview
Investigation of quality of life variations between Golborne and Brompton & Hans Town wards in Kensington and Chelsea.

## Current Status

### Completed Components
1. Basic Structure:
   - Full template implementation
   - Section numbering system
   - Consistent formatting standards

2. Content Integration:
   - Introduction (complete)
   - Methodology (complete)
   - Literature review (complete)
   - Theoretical framework (complete)
   - Brompton & Hans Town photographic analysis (complete)
   - Initial data presentation sections (complete)

3. Formatting:
   - Harvard citation style implemented
   - Table formatting standardized
   - Section headers consistent
   - Basic figure referencing system established

### In Progress Components
1. Data Analysis:
   - Remaining environmental analysis sections
   - Social deprivation evidence integration
   - Economic prosperity data organization
   - Photographic analysis of Golborne Road

2. Figure Organization:
   - Sequential numbering needed
   - Caption standardization required
   - Cross-reference verification needed

3. Conclusions:
   - Hypothesis-specific conclusions need expansion
   - Overall evaluation needs completion
   - Methodological assessment needs refinement

## Priority Tasks

### Immediate Actions
1. Complete Golborne Road photographic analysis in Appendix G
2. Integrate remaining data analysis sections
3. Standardize figure numbering and captions
4. Complete hypothesis-specific conclusions

### Short-term Tasks
1. Write abstract
2. Complete contents page
3. Create comprehensive figure list
4. Add final bibliography entries

### Long-term Tasks
1. Quality control review
2. Citation verification
3. Cross-reference check
4. Final formatting review

   - Analysis follows methodology

2. Format Checks:
   - Consistent spacing
   - Proper indentation
   - Table alignment

3. Reference Checks:
   - Citation accuracy
   - Bibliography completeness
   - Figure numbering sequence

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority
1. Complete Appendix G Golborne Road analysis using the same structure as BHT section
2. Integrate remaining data presentation sections
3. Standardize all figure references

### Secondary Priority
1. Complete hypothesis conclusions
2. Write abstract
3. Create figure list
4. Review all citations

### Final Steps
1. Quality control review
2. Format verification
3. Cross-reference check
4. Final proofreading

## Additional Notes
- Maintain consistent voice throughout
- Ensure evidence supports all claims
- Keep theoretical framework connections clear
- Preserve existing formatting conventions
